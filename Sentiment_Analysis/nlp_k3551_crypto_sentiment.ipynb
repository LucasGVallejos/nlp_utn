To estimate whether the cryptocurrency market is currently leaning bearish or bullish, we consider a number of technical indicators, including moving averages and oscillators.

We provide historical Bitcoin sentiment data, so you can get a better understanding of how the sentiment in the market has changed over time. We also provide information about the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index , which is a tool for estimating whether market participants are currently exhibiting fear or greed.

Thu, October 12 at 7:00PM ET Days Hours Minutes Seconds Register Here (FREE) Home / Crypto & Blockchain / 7 Cryptos to Watch as Market Sentiment Hits a Snag SPECIAL REPORT 5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Before They Skyrocket Advertisement Bitcoin ( BTC ): Bitcoin bulls look forward to an eventual challenge of 40K. Ethereum ( ETH ): Ethereum’s been strong but it faces a new obstacle ahead. Tether ( USDT ): Tether suffered a relative deceleration in its peg to the dollar. Read on for more information on top cryptocurrencies to watch! Source: Maxx-Studio / Shutterstock.com After hitting a high of nearly $1.3 trillion a few days ago, the total market capitalization of all cryptos settled to around $1.26 trillion late Monday evening. Part of the culprit centers on possible technical considerations. As the Motley Fool noted, traders who took bullish bets through derivatives and leverage may have been forced to unwind their positions . Fundamentally, the U.S. dollar saw a rise in value , which prompted a reactionary move. Typically, cryptos and the greenback share a negative price correlation: as one goes up, the other goes down. In addition, CoinDesk points to a mixed bag of first-quarter earnings results which imposed pressure on digital assets.\\xa0Moving forward, investors will be assessing further clues from the broader economy to see if the recent boom in blockchain-derived assets can continue progressing. Below are seven cryptos to watch closely. BTC-USD Bitcoin $30,180.40 ETH-USD Ethereum $2,081.33 USDT-USD Tether $1.00 BNB-USD BNB. $341.39 XRP-USD XRP. $0.52 ADA-USD Cardano $0.44 DOGE-USD Dogecoin $0.09 Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Source: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com Heading into the early morning hours of the Tuesday session, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) suffered a noticeable blip to its recent surge. After scraping the $31,000 level last week, traders began to take some profits off the table. In the past 24 hours, BTC declined by more than 1%. In the trailing seven days, it’s down almost 2%. On the positive front, advocates of cryptos remain encouraged about the latest developments. Since tumbling sharply last year, Bitcoin first had to reclaim the baseline $20,000 level. From there, 30K represented an obvious upside target. Having reached the target, eyes now focus on the big one: 40K.\\xa0However, on the less-than-encouraging side of the spectrum, investors need to monitor the volume situation. Around mid-March, BTC shot up higher based on a few sessions of strong volume. Since then, however, volume steadily decline. Ideally, you’d like to see rising volume levels confirm rising prices. Unfortunately, we’re getting the opposite: higher prices, fading volume. Therefore, investors need to tread carefully. Ethereum (ETH-USD) Source: Thaninee Chuensomchit / Shutterstock.com The other asset that captured the spotlight among cryptos was Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Heading into the Tuesday early morning session, ETH ended up losing 1.5% in the past 24 hours. In the trailing week, Ethereum disassociated from Bitcoin, instead gaining slightly over 9%. For the bulls, advocates will point to sustained enthusiasm for ETH. At time of writing, the asset trades hands for around $2,090. That’s well above its 50-day moving average, which sits at $1,765. Also, its 200 DMA runs even lower at around $1,485. On the other end, ETH seems to run a little hot based on its relative strength indicator reading of 69.15. Also, Ethereum suffers from the same volume situation as Bitcoin, though to a lesser extent. Basically, volume trends refuse to decisively confirm ETH’s upside moves.\\xa0Looking ahead, the bulls will likely need to push upward into the $2,600 level where some horizontal support lies. Otherwise, the recent lack of volume suggests some turbulence may be coming soon. Tether (USDT-USD) Source: DIAMOND VISUALS / Shutterstock.com Representing the most powerful stablecoin – or class of cryptos that’s pegged to the dollar – Tether ( USDT-USD ) keeps the machinery of the blockchain market ecosystem well oiled. Therefore, its fluctuations may act as a forward signal for future moves. Interestingly, USDT printed slight red ink, both in the past 24 hours and in the trailing seven sessions. No, I don’t think it’s time to hit the panic button. However, data from Stockcharts notes a significant increase in bearish volume. Later, turning to Coinmarketcap , Tether’s peg to the greenback declined from slightly above parity to exactly at parity. Seemingly, the data confirms the overall trading action in cryptos: folks that used derivatives or leverage to speculate on certain digital assets must now unwind their positions. It’s possible that some took the next step of converting USDT to fiat dollars, leading to more supply of Tether.\\xa0Moving forward, investors should monitor the Tether peg to the dollar for significant fluctuations. That could be the warning sign for the next big move in cryptos. BNB (BNB-USD) Source: Robert Paternoster / Shutterstock.com A beneficiary of renewed interest in cryptos after the underlying ecosystem suffered a credibility crisis last year, BNB ( BNB-USD ) also took a breather recently. In the past 24 hours, the digital asset slipped almost 1%. However, in the trailing one-week period, the coin managed to gain over 5% of market value. Overall, proponents of BNB should be satisfied with its performance this year. Getting off to a strong start in January, BNB managed to march higher, albeit with a pronounced deceleration between mid-February through mid-March. Since then, the asset regained its composure, rising above both its 50 and 200 DMAs. Looking ahead, BNB advocates will be targeting the $375 to $400 level, which is where horizontal support lies. On paper, that’s not exactly the tallest of orders. At time of writing, BNB trades hands at around $345. However, it too suffers from a similar challenge impacting other cryptos: lack of confirmation from its volume trend.\\xa0Investors should probably monitor Bitcoin, along with Tether’s peg to the dollar for nearer-term guidance. XRP (XRP-USD) Source: Shutterstock One of the most popular alternative cryptos or altcoins, XRP ( XRP-USD ) first achieved fundamental prominence for facilitating sustainable microtransactions; that is, being able to transmit small units of wealth without exorbitant transfer fees. Unfortunately XRP founder Ripple Labs caught the ire of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed suit against Ripple for alleged securities violations. However, XRP has performed well recently. In the trailing 24 hours, XRP actually poked its head above parity, albeit very slightly. In the trailing seven days, it lost approximately 2% of market value. Overall, though, XRP managed to blow past its 50 and 200 DMAs in March, which acted as resistance barriers. Better yet, it’s been able to sustain those gains. Of course, a bigger challenge lies ahead. After becoming overheated late last month based on the RSI indicator, trading for XRP has been somewhat choppy. Moving forward, the bulls will need to target the 80-cent level, where horizontal support lies.\\xa0The thing is, that’s a big move to go to 80 cents from the time-of-writing price of 51 cents. Therefore, investors should exercise caution. Cardano (ADA-USD) Source: Shutterstock Transitioning from one of the most popular non-Bitcoin cryptos to one of the sector’s most frustrating assets, Cardano ( ADA-USD ) has taken longtime investors on a ride. Personally, I won’t be participating in that ride, having converted my holdings to another digital asset for consolidation’s sake. That said, those who have kept the faith since the start of this year have been rewarded. In the past 24 hours, ADA gained about 0.2%, which is relatively impressive considering the losses in other cryptos. Also, in the past seven days, it gained almost 10% of market value. That’s unquestionably impressive. Bolstering sentiment is the fact that right now, ADA at 44.4 cents trades well above its 50 DMA (37 cents) and 200 DMA (35.2 cents). In the near term, the bulls will be looking to secure the 50-cent level. However, assuming it gets there, Cardano faces a massive obstacle of $1. That’s really where ADA needs to move. After all, at its peak, ADA looked to challenge the $3 level. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Source: Zarko Prusac / Shutterstock.com Finally, we’ll end this list of cryptos to watch on a lighthearted note with Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), everyone’s favorite meme coin. Although it earns a reputation for being extremely speculative, DOGE performed remarkably well recently. In the past 24 hours, DOGE gained 4% of market value. In the trailing one-week period, it’s up nearly 9%. Unlike other cryptos, Dogecoin sparked bullish momentum starting from the tail end of March to the start of this month. At the moment, DOGE trades hands at 9.3 cents, above its 200 DMA (8.2 cents) and 50 DMA (7.9 cents). However, it also incurred a familiar problem: generally speaking, volume trended lower while prices moved higher. Given the speculative appeal of Dogecoin, it’s really anyone’s guess where the digital asset may end up. Moving forward, if the bulls want momentum to sustain, it must make a legitimate attempt at around 14 cents, where horizontal support lies. From there, investors will be targeting 20 cents.\\xa0One thing can likely be taken to the bank: DOGE will provide a wild ride. So, prospective investors should be ready for anything.

With Bitcoin ( BTC -2.19% ) soaring more than 70% to start the year, its overall market capitalization has also soared, to more than $545 billion. As a result, Bitcoin now accounts for about 46% of the entire $1.2 trillion crypto market.\\xa0Even though there are literally thousands of different cryptos, it seems like the only one that matters right now is Bitcoin. This ratio of Bitcoin market cap to total crypto market cap, known as Bitcoin dominance, is a popular metric.\\xa0It has historically been used as a powerful indicator to predict the future price of Bitcoin, as well as to gauge overall market sentiment for crypto. Here's a closer look at what this important Bitcoin metric is telling us now. Image source: Getty Images. Bitcoin Dominance trending up As seen in the chart, the Bitcoin dominance metric has spiked this year, from about 40% at the end of 2022 to the current level of about 46% (it was a bit higher when this chart was created). This suggests that Bitcoin is playing a more important role in the overall crypto market. While other cryptos are also up for the year, Bitcoin is outpacing them in terms of price appreciation. Data source: Trading View. There are several possible reasons for this. One explanation, quite simply, is that fear and anxiety in the financial market is pushing people to embrace Bitcoin as a potential safe harbor . When given a choice between a speculative altcoin and Bitcoin, it's a no-brainer for most people these days: You buy Bitcoin. Until the current economic uncertainty clears, one can expect Bitcoin dominance to increase. Historical levels of Bitcoin Dominance While the current level of Bitcoin dominance might appear high, it's actually well below historical averages. As seen in the chart, for a long time, Bitcoin dominance was close to 99%. This is because Bitcoin was basically the only crypto in town from 2009 until Ethereum ( ETH -0.55% ) launched in 2015. Even with the emergence of new cryptos, Bitcoin dominance was still close to 96% in early 2017. That quickly changed with the initial coin offering (ICO) mania and new buzz around Ethereum. As a result, Bitcoin dominance plunged to less than 40% in a very short period of time. In hindsight, we can now recognize that this foreshadowed the onset of a crypto winter in 2018. Data source: Trading View. While it's almost a given that Bitcoin dominance will never reach its old historical highs, it will be interesting to see just how high it will go in the current market cycle. Before the last crypto bull market rally, for example, Bitcoin dominance fluctuated between 60% and 70%, as seen in the chart. Data source: Trading View. Thus, one story that this metric could be telling us now is that there will be further consolidation into Bitcoin until we start to hit Bitcoin dominance levels of at least 60%. At that point, the broader market could be ready for a sharp rally, and there could be an explosion of interest around more speculative altcoins. Putting it all together The important caveat here is that using a metric like Bitcoin dominance by itself is problematic for long-term investors. You might start to mistake short-term market zigs and zags for long-term market trends. For example, look again at Bitcoin dominance in 2023. It's not a straight upward trajectory for this metric; there are plenty of head-fakes and feints along the way. Just remember: You are looking for long-term trends, not short-term trading opportunities. Moreover, it is not so much the absolute level of the metric that matters, as how this metric is changing over time. Simply saying that Bitcoin dominance is at 46% is meaningless. What matters is the context of knowing that it started the year at 40%, so we are in an upward cycle for Bitcoin dominance. Moreover, this metric is still sitting at relatively low historical levels. That said, the Bitcoin dominance metric is so powerful because it is so simple. There are not a lot of moving pieces, the data is readily available, and the simple math behind this metric enables one to tell very powerful narratives about the crypto market. At the end of the day, there's only a numerator and a denominator for this metric, and it's your job as an investor to figure out what is happening with each. A bullish signal for Bitcoin? Generally speaking, a rising Bitcoin dominance metric, combined with strong upward momentum in Bitcoin's price, is bullish. Conversely, a rising Bitcoin dominance metric, combined with a decline in the price of Bitcoin, is potentially bearish for Bitcoin. What I'm seeing here is a bullish signal for Bitcoin: The price is rising, and overall Bitcoin dominance is rising. Bitcoin traditionally leads the crypto market both higher and lower, and Bitcoin's recent rise appears to be pulling the rest of the crypto market along with it. At some point, investors will have enough confidence to start investing in other cryptos alongside Bitcoin. That's when Bitcoin dominance may begin to decline. So keep your eyes on Bitcoin dominance in the coming months. As of now, all signals are flashing green for Bitcoin. Dominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

One Twitter user projects BTC to hit $98 million in two decades. Bitcoin Price Analysis Fundamentals For speculators, everything is about price. Pricing dominate and with fluctuating crypto assets, traders have a home in crypto. Analysts have on numerous occasions aired their two cents. Most are optimistic that Bitcoin as a problem-solving network whose native coin is shaping the financial landscape is here to stay. As a result, they interpret value and a possible undervaluation. Their ballpark estimation of what BTC would be in say five or ten years is around the $50k mark. However, there is a new breed of believers who after their analysis think that Bitcoin—and in that case liquid asset—are grossly undervalued. One of them going by the Twitter handle, Moon_Rekt project Bitcoin to surge to $98 million in a record-breaking 20 years. Affirming his projections are a combination of several factors including the role of hodlers, the increasing scarcity of the world’s most valuable asset and then next years’ halving that will see miner rewards drop by 50 percents. 1/ This thread will explain why Bitcoin will become the first world currency worth ≈ $98 Million USD per Bitcoin (in today’s dollars). Timeline: 1-2 Decades — Moon Capital ?? (@Moon__Capital) April 12, 2019 Adding that are the advantages of Bitcoin and all other blockchain networks. Some of them include the security, fungibility of prices not content of block and then divisibility of an asset which places it above Gold, whose market cap is around $7.7 trillion. Once high net-worth players begin shifting from Gold as a store of value to Bitcoin taking advantage of what the network has to offer, the optimistic holder expects BTC to soar. Candlestick Arrangements After two weeks of above-average gains, Bitcoin (BTC) is slowing down, up 0.6 percent in the last day. However, what is encouraging is the reaction from $5,000 and rejection of lower lows. From the charts, it is clear that our previous BTC/USD trade plan is valid. As a result, every low is technically another buying opportunity. In that case, both sets of traders should take advantage of positive sentiment and favorable candlestick alignment to load up with aggressive participants taking at spot rates with stops at Apr-11 lows at $4,900—data streams from BitFinex. Technical Indicators In line with current developments and risk of lower lows, Apr-12 bear bar anchors our analysis. With light volumes—19k against 21k average, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls will be back in contention as risk-averse traders flow in once prices rally past $5,500 with volumes exceeding 19k.

Caroline Ellison And SBF's Plot To Suppress BTC Under $20K Bitcoin Sentiment Returns To Neutral As Price Tumbles Down by Keshav Verma 8 months ago in Bitcoin 0 Data shows the Bitcoin market sentiment has declined to neutral today as the price of the asset has dropped below the $22,000 level. Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Now Points At “Neutral” Sentiment The “ fear and greed index ” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin market. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for displaying the sentiment. All values above the 50 mark suggest the market is greedy right now, while those below the threshold imply investors are fearful. While this break may be clean in theory, the boundary values between 46 and 54 are actually treated as a “neutral” sentiment in practice. There are also two other special sentiments, called “extreme greed” and “ extreme fear .” These take place at values of the index higher than 75 and lower than 25, respectively. The significance of the extreme sentiments is that tops and bottoms in the price of Bitcoin have historically tended to take place in periods with such mentalities. Because of this reason, some traders believe it’s best to buy during extreme fear (where bottoms form), while extreme greed (where tops occur) provides the ideal selling windows. Now, here is what the fear and greed index looks like for the current market: The current sentiment in the BTC, as well as the wider crypto, market | Source: Alternative As displayed above, the Bitcoin fear and greed index has a value of 48 at the moment, which suggests that the investors have a neutral sentiment with a slight lean toward fear. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Tops Crypto Market In This Metric This is a drop in value as compared to recent days when the market had been greedy. The below chart shows how the indicator’s value has changed over the past year. Looks like the value of the metric has seen some decline in recent days | Source: Alternative From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin fear and greed index had been at fear and extreme fear values for most of the past year. Both these fear and extreme fear streaks were in fact the longest ever in the history of the indicator. The run finally came to an end earlier this year, when the rally in the price of the cryptocurrency finally lifted investor sentiment out of the fear zone. Initially, the mentality was only neutral, but as the rally advanced further, holders finally started embracing the bullish trend and became greedy. After spending some days in the greed zone, the metric has once again returned to a neutral value today as a result of the latest drawdown in BTC that has taken the price of the coin below $22,000.

       "  'text': 'Bitcoin bounces off summer lows in wake of risk-on sentiment (Cryptocurrency:BTC-USD) | Seeking Alpha Skip to content Explore Alpha Picks Subscribe to Premium Home Analysis News Market Data Investing Groups Explore Investing Groups Portfolios Create Portfolio Find & Compare Top Stocks Top ETFs Stock Screener ETF Screener Comparisons Explore Alpha Picks Subscribe to Premium N Rotteveel/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) bounced off its summer lows in Wednesday mid-afternoon trading as investors\\' appetite for riskier assets improved. The original cryptocurrency climbed 2.8% to $26.5K at 4:07 p.m. ET, after reaching as low as $25.6K in the previous session, though it\\'s still down 10.6% over the last month as the notion that interest rates will stay higher for longer -- along with other hurdles -- weighs on the crypto market. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the largest altcoin by market cap, also made a partial comeback, advancing 3.4% to $1.68K. Elsewhere in the cryptosphere, Near Protocol\\'s NEAR ( NEAR-USD ) extended its intraday gains to 8.5% a day after crypto exchange Nexo said it integrated the token on its platform. The upswings, against a backdrop of low liquidity and trading volumes, coincided with bullish price action across the major stock averages that was helped by chip stocks and a retreat in Treasury yields. Crypto-related stocks, of course, changed hands in the green. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) +5.1% , Bitfarms ( BITF ) +8.6% , Bit Digital ( BTBT ) +8.7% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ) +3.9% , Bakkt ( BKKT ) +5.9% and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) +7.3% were among some of the biggest winners.

Cryptonews News Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Smashes Past $27,000 Resistance â\\x80\\x93 Best Time to Buy? Ali B. @ali-b Oct 3, 2023 4:21 PM EDT Â· 3 min read Ali B. @ali-b m Bitcoin Price Prediction as BTC Smashes Past $27,000 Resistance â\\x80\\x93 Best Time to Buy? Bitcoin (BTC) , the world's largest cryptocurrency, experienced a dip below the $28,000 mark in the early hours of Tuesday. The cryptocurrency had an exciting start to the week as it surged past the $28,000 threshold on Monday, marking its best performance since August. This surge contributed to the overall crypto market cap reaching $1.09 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) leading the way in this impressive rally. BTC has fallen below the $28,000 mark and is currently trading at $27,500, indicating a high level of market volatility. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic conditions, it is expected that the markets will continue to be unstable in the coming weeks. The global crypto market capitalization stands at $1.09 trillion, with a 24-hour decline of nearly 2%. Bitcoin's Price Concerns Amid Recession Worries Bitcoin has recently crossed the $28,000 mark, which is positive news. However, there are concerns in the cryptocurrency market. Bloomberg analyst, Mike McGlone , has raised some worries. He believes that cryptocurrencies may be at risk of a recession, particularly due to their poor performance in the third quarter. There are concerns about the digital asset world being in trouble. Some people are wondering if the current weakness is just a temporary issue or if it's a sign of a bigger problem. According to McGlone and several analysts, it's more likely the latter, which indicates that a recession for cryptocurrencies could be on the horizon. As a result, this news could negatively impact Bitcoin's price, as investors may become more cautious and hesitant, leading to selling pressure and a potential decline in BTC's value. Uncertainty often prompts investors to seek safer assets, which may divert capital away from cryptocurrencies. Optimistic Sentiment and Potential for BTC's Price Bitcoin's recent climb above $28,000 has traders hoping for a return to $30,000, but it slipped back to $27,300. Despite this setback, market sentiment remains optimistic. Santiment's monthly report indicates the crypto community is bullish on Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies like LINK, AAVE, and ETH. According to Santiment, Bitcoin could reach $30,000 soon. Positive sentiment may attract buyers and prevent sharp declines, but it's important to monitor developments closely as Bitcoin's price remains volatile. Bitcoin Price Prediction Upon closer examination of Bitcoin 's 4-hour chart, various significant price levels become apparent. The pivot point, a crucial metric, is fixed at $27,347. Bitcoin encounters resistance levels at $28,706, followed by $29,417 and $30,275. In contrast, the immediate support for Bitcoin is located at $26,636, with additional support levels at $26,000 and $25,325. Another notable metric is the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which is currently valued at $27,000, indicating a bullish sign as Bitcoin's price is trading above this level. Bitcoin Price Chart - Source: Tradingview Bitcoin is presenting a symmetrical triangle pattern in the chart patterns realm. At the $27,350 mark, the pattern culminates with a breakout. In the past, such breakouts have often signalled the beginning of bullish momentum, indicating that Bitcoin's rise may continue. To summarize, Bitcoin's path appears to be strongly bullish. Investors may consider buying above $27,500, with targets set at $28,800 or $29,300. However, it's important to note that if Bitcoin struggles to surpass the $28,300 barrier, it may trigger a trend of selling. In the coming days, Bitcoin appears ready to challenge the $28,800 resistance level. If the market remains favourable, there may be a realistic opportunity for Bitcoin to reach the $29,300 peak.

While the digital asset continues to hold the $16,000 level, investors have backed off from the market, ensuring no significant movements either up or down, and as a result, investor sentiment hasn’t moved. Bitcoin Investors Still In Fear The crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that bitcoin investor sentiment hasn’t really moved much in the last month. It closed out the month of November at a score of 29 which put it right in the fear territory but since then has been unable to break out of this trend. Related Reading: Solana Suffers Double-Digit Losses, Is There An End In Sight? The score on this index over the month of December has staggered between 26-30 for the most part, maintaining a nearly straight-line trend during this period. Even now, the Fear & Greed Index sits at a score of 28 and is up one point from last week’s close of 27. Fear & Greed Index trends in an almost straight line | Source: alternative.me What this trend in the Fear & Greed Index shows is that bitcoin investors are not willing to take any risk. This is why the index has been unable to move into the greed territory. On the flip side, sell sentiment has not been as strong as expected during a time like this. If investors were selling more of their bitcoin, then it would have been obvious given that the index would slide further down. Instead, it continues to maintain a near-consistent score level, meaning hold sentiment now dominates the market. Will BTC See A Recovery Soon? Bitcoin is still finding a hard time regaining the momentum it has lost over the past month. This hesitancy from investors to do anything with their tokens has seen the price of the digital asset follow the same path as sentiment. BTC has now refused to move out of the $16,000 price level. BTC price maintains $16,000 level | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com As a result of this, bitcoin volatility has fallen to historical lows. So it is likely that the last two days of the year 2022 will follow this same trend. Recovery should not be expected in any way because momentum will continue to decline as people take a break from the markets to celebrate with family.

Anything below this level would be very bearish and could trigger more declines in the market as bears take control. But a finish above $16,000 strengthens investors’ resolve to hold their coins. BTC is changing hands at a price of $16,519 at the time of this writing. Its price is down 0.43% in the last 24 hours and 2.01% in the last 7 days.

Here’s what’s happening: Prices: Ethereum\\'s Shanghai upgrade is a few days away, but that isn\\'t translating into selling pressure because most staked ether is at a loss. Insights: In his latest Money Reimagined column, CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey argues that the recent backlash against the crypto industry stems from the alleged misdeeds of disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

Good morning Asia. Bitcoin is opening the Asia trading week up 1.3% at $28,383, while ether is up 0.5% to $1,863. The CoinDesk Market Index , a measure of the overall crypto market\\'s performance, is up about 1%. “The market leader has traded in a very tight range in the last week, barely moving much. Such consolidation, along with lowering volume, could indicate that a sharp move is around the corner,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of Bitbull Capital, said in a note to CoinDesk. DiPasquale said that a correction toward $25,000 wouldn\\'t “break the bullish structure, whereas a move to $30K is likely to face resistance.” “The market sentiment currently remains positive, and we may see select altcoins perform decently if bitcoin remains in the current range for longer,” he added. Ether\\'s relatively flat performance may allay fears that the Ethereum blockchain\\'s Shanghai software upgrade, scheduled for mid-week, will bring selling pressure . CryptoQuant wrote in a research report from February that the majority of ether staked was at a loss, with the average loss at 18%. “Typically, selling pressure emerges when market participants are sitting on extreme profits, which is not the case right now for the ether that has been staked,” the firm wrote.

Last week, I warned of a dangerous politicization trend in U.S. crypto policy following a barrage of regulatory enforcement actions taken against this industry. I remain concerned about that trend, but my view is now slightly more nuanced thanks to the insights of two people with very good D.C. connections. They explained how emotions – specifically anger and embarrassment – played a huge role in driving those policy actions. It reminded me of the importance of clear, inviolable rules of governance, whether they’re baked into democratic institutions such as the U.S. Constitution or forged into consensus mechanisms used by open-source software communities, like those attached to blockchain protocols. Regulation by retribution Among a string of “Thanks Sam” moments these past five months, this one takes the cake. You can argue that the crackdown against Kraken , Coinbase , Paxos , Binance and others was driven significantly by a desire to punish Sam Bankman-Fried, the erstwhile founder of FTX, whose mind-blowingly rapid collapse in November sent shock waves through the crypto industry. This is how one of my sources described the mindset of Biden administration officials and of lawmakers from both political parties: “You can’t come into their house, slosh that kind of money around, leave politicians with egg on their faces and not expect to pay a huge price.” He was referring to the fact that before the FTX meltdown, politicians  – mostly Democrats but also some Republicans – had been beneficiaries of more than $74 million in political donations from FTX and had forged connections with Bankman-Fried, who had wooed progressives with his “effective altruism” commitments. (A CoinDesk investigation found that one-third of Congress took money from Bankman-Fried or his associates.) Find the full story here : Important events.

       "  'text': \"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Rises 4% Amidst Dovish FOMC Sentiment Cryptonews News Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Rises 4% Amidst Dovish FOMC Sentiment Ali B. @ali-b Sep 19, 2023 4:25 AM EDT Â· 3 min read Ali B. @ali-b m Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Rises 4% Amidst Dovish FOMC Sentiment Bitcoin (BTC) , the world's largest cryptocurrency, continued its upward trend and came very close to reaching the $27,000 mark on Tuesday. Initially, BTC surged past the $27,000 level, which is the highest it has been since August 31st. The reason behind the surge could be attributed to the market's anticipation of the upcoming meeting of the US Federal Reserve, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to temporarily pause interest rate hikes. The rising number of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications has caught the attention of investors worldwide, and is believed to be a crucial factor in the overall expansion of the cryptocurrency market. The increased interest in Bitcoin ETFs has helped drive up the price of BTC, contributing to its recent surge past the $27,000 mark. Bitcoin has experienced a 2.50% increase in value this month, which adds up to a remarkable 61% gain for the year. If this positive trend continues, Bitcoin's value could exceed $28,000. It's worth noting that the entire cryptocurrency market appears to be bullish, with many digital currencies posting significant gains. Bitcoin's Recent Surge: Increased Interest and Bullish Signs Bitcoin's price is being influenced by various factors, including a surge in trading activity which has resulted in Bitcoin's open interest exceeding $1 billion. This suggests a heightened interest in the cryptocurrency and is contributing to BTC gains. Moreover, there has been a rise in call options, indicating a bullish sentiment, especially after Bitcoin surpassed the $26.5K mark. This bullish trend gained momentum due to a significant short liquidation of over $30 million in put positions, which created new long positions and drove buying demand. Besides this, the number of new Bitcoin addresses created hit a five-year high of 26,808. Additionally, the transaction count reached a four-month peak of $23,724, which may indicate rising demand and positive long-term prospects for Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin Price Prediction On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin has shown resilience, finding notable support around the 26,750 mark. Evidently, BTC has stabilized with a tweezer bottom pattern forming just above this level. This 26,750 threshold carries significant technical weight; earlier on the 4-hour chart, it served as a double top resistance, but once breached, it transitioned into a vital support for BTC. Furthermore, there was a descending trend line previously on the chart, originating from recent highs. Its breach ignited a bullish momentum, but following some corrections, this trend line now bolsters BTC from below, acting as support. The 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) also converges at this point, reinforcing its importance. The tweezer bottoms close above this EMA augments the likelihood of a continued bullish trend for BTC. Bitcoin Price Chart - Source: Tradingview Given this backdrop, there's potential for Bitcoin to target the next resistance at 27,450. Beyond that, 27,850 stands as a prominent hurdle. Conversely, if the 26,750 support is compromised, we might see a bearish drive pushing BTC towards 26,400 and possibly down to 25,900. In summary, the 26,750 level is pivotal. A sustained position above this could hint at an extended bullish phase for BTC.

       "  'text': 'Is the future of bitcoin safe? A triangulation approach in the reality of BTC market through a sentiments analysis | SpringerLink Skip to main content Advertisement Home Digital Finance Article Is the future of bitcoin safe? A triangulation approach in the reality of BTC market through a sentiments analysis Download PDF Download PDF Abstract Bitcoin (BTC) prices are fluctuating continuously to the extremes. The Bitcoin market witnessed a crash during the second quarter of 2021 that was purely guided by the investors’ sentiments. Are the Bitcoin prices influenced only by market sentiments or do any factors influence them? In this paper, we applied a triangulation approach; mixed-methods research was used in which a qualitative study was complemented by a quantitative method. Both the qualitative and quantitative data of time periods 2016–2021 were examined to find whether the Bitcoin market prices are influenced by market sentiments. For analysing market sentiments, the posts and sentiments from 2016 to 2021 of an internet forum “Bitcointalk” were used. For strengthening the findings of qualitative analysis, we used quantitative data of the BTC market. We also used search data from Google Trends for providing further insights. Our research shows a crossmatch between quantitative trends on Bitcoin market prices and qualitative matrix of sentiments. We have also observed an artificial investment intention in the form of digital nudges playing the field of the Bitcoin market to boost investment. Working on a manuscript? Avoid the common mistakes 1 Introduction Bitcoin is exhibiting tremendous growth in value and popularity. Twelve years after its inception in 2008 by the pseudonymous coder Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin price has been skyrocketing to unprecedented heights. A vital characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that currency prices fluctuate based on people’s perceptions and opinions. Many investors are attracted to Bitcoin due to its high liquidity, low transaction costs, and easy transaction across the internet (Zheng et al., 2019 ). However, the price of Bitcoin is influenced by market sentiments (Eom et al., 2019 ). Sentiments—investors’ thoughts, feelings, and moods regarding an asset—influence the BTC market prices. There is a correlation between Bitcoin’s price and changes in search query volumes of people (Karalevicius et al., 2018 ). Wołk ( 2019 ) also supported this argument, explaining further that the cryptocurrency price depends heavily on social media sentiments and web search analytics tools such as Google Trends. Currently, cryptocurrency holders worldwide are in a panic as the Bitcoin prices are fluctuating wildly. They are sliding down and climbing up continuously. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweet on 12 May 2021 saying that his company would no longer accept Bitcoins started the BTC market meltdown. Bitcoin fell by 40% from its record high levels of $65,000 to $31,000 on the same day. Experts blame Musk\\'s tweets for the great fall of the BTC market. This sudden fall in the BTC value shows the influence of a single tweet on the value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Naturally, a question arises: are the sentiments of investors responsible for the crash of Bitcoin? In this paper, we address this question by examining the effect of these sentiments on the BTC market. We compare the quantitative data of the BTC market with the corresponding qualitative data and assess the insights of the relationship between the frequency of emotions and the time-series line-up of BTC prices. Our research also tries to find out the trend variation in price by taking qualitative and quantitative data, which makes this article novel and unique. 2 Background of the study Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not backed by any tangible or intangible assets of intrinsic value (Reserve et al., 2018 ). The fundamental price of Bitcoin is zero, as there is no intrinsic value associated with Bitcoin (Cheah & Fry, 2015 ). Hence, the BTC market cannot be predicted according to economic valuation models such as the fundamental and technical analyses. The existence of herding in the crypto market and the non-existence of an intrinsic value makes it harder to identify Bitcoin\\'s fair value by the investors. This may sometimes lead to overvaluation or undervaluation. We can also see an excessive optimism in investors who may be influenced by the intentional digital nudges through social networking forums in the BTC market. In addition, bubbles can emerge faster and more robustly due to irrational herding, social pressure, and bandwagon effect (Kaiser & Stockl, 2020 ). Moreover, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, investment planning, and all the rationality assumptions of the modern financial theories are irrelevant in the current scenario of Bitcoin investment. Though there are numerous academic pieces of literature on the crypto markets, studies that examine the cross-relationship of qualitative data on investors ‘sentiments and quantitative data on the Bitcoin market prices are rare. However, such studies would be a valuable addition to crypto literature. The rest of the article is structured as follows: Sect. 3 provides an extensive literature review and theoretical underpinnings of related studies on BTC. Section 4 discusses the core objectives and research questions of the study, and subsequently, Sect. 5 deals with methodology. The results and discussion are presented in Sect. 6 . The conclusion and future research openings are provided in Sect. 7 , while policy implications have been noted in Sect. 8 . The results of our paper could be useful to policymakers and regulators who wish to have insights into the BTC market and its future development. 3 Literature review 3.1 Theories on the growth of BTC Bitcoin is virtual money derived from mathematical cryptography and conceived as an alternative to government-backed currencies (Cheah & Fry, 2015 ). Even though it was operationalised in 2009, Bitcoin caught the attention of the mainstream investors only in 2012. At the global level, the sudden growth of Bitcoin happened in a brief span, say 10 years. The crypto market has since then had the first-generation, second generation and third generation of currencies, of which those in the third generation are still in their infancy (Hendrickson & Luther, 2021 ; Schilling & Uhlig, 2019 ). However, recently the crypto user base is dramatically increasing worldwide. Bitcoin and other digital currencies may have a sizeable long-term effect on both cash and payment systems (Brandvold et al., 2015 ). Cryptocurrencies embody innovative technology, high-security architecture, prosperity in functionalities, and investment opportunity as assets that make them attractive to computer scientists, venture capitalists, and investors (Klein et al., 2018 ). Hong et al. ( 2018 ) suggested that the factors that lead to the growth of cryptos are the extremely high costs associated with the use (medium of exchange and store of value) of fiat currencies and the extremely low costs associated with the use of the cryptos. Moreover, the failure of fiat currency in countries such as Zimbabwe and Lebanon has added to the popularity of the crypto movement. People started hearing about cryptocurrencies when Bitcoin came into the picture. Hence, it is often regarded as the father of cryptocurrencies, and all other cryptocurrencies are referred to as altcoins (Sovbetov, 2018 ). The recent news that El-Salvador has accepted BTC and officially adopted it as legal tender was a surprising and positive news to Bitcoin fans all over the world. 3.2 Pricing of Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies do not have an underlying value such as fiat currencies, corporate stocks and bonds. The cryptocurrencies are more demand sensitive, so the market value depends more on how well known the currency is (Pärlstrand et al, 2015 ). Since its inception, Bitcoin has been the most popular cryptocurrency, so its market value too has been rising in an unprecedented manner. Since Bitcoin belongs to a global arena, its value is fundamentally identical across different markets. Therefore, the price is globally determined and cannot be influenced over a more extended period by the individual markets across countries. Kapar and Olmo ( 2021 ) established a long-run relationship between Bitcoin and a set of variables with power to explain the dynamics of cryptocurrency using cointegration methods. Bitcoin is procyclin, driven by investors’ interest in cryptocurrency, and is positively correlated to the market portfolio. Nowadays, Bitcoin follows the trend exhibited by financial markets and cannot be considered as a purely alternative asset. The uncertainly of global economic policies have had both positive and negative causal impacts on Bitcoin returns. However, it cannot always be viewed as a new basket for eggs (Qin et al., 2021 ). The significant factors that affect Bitcoin pricing are returns on the S&P 500, NIFTY 50, SENSEX30 and other popular market indices. Traditional asset valuation models fall short of effectively explaining recent developments in Bitcoin price. However, some of the financial models suggest that Bitcoin is currently overpriced (Pano & Kashef, 2020 ). Moreover, Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis (Beshenov & Rozmainsky, 2015 ) seems a better fit in explaining Bitcoin’s recent price developments than any of the proven economic theories available as mentioned by Joost van der Burgt Footnote 1 . While examining the association of the Bitcoin price crash risk with economic uncertainty, it is evident that economic uncertainty displays a significant negative correlation with Bitcoin price crash risk. Research by Kalyvas et al. ( 2020 )indicates that when economic uncertainty is high, the crash risk of Bitcoin is low. Moreover, the behavioural factors have insignificant relation with Bitcoin crash risk. In such cases, investors can hedge against the economic uncertainty influence of other financial assets by investing in the BTC market. The theory proposes that since the Bitcoin market is moving against the macro fundamentals of the economy, emotions are the primary determinant of demand of the Bitcoin market. 3.3 Investors ‘bias and price volatility of BTC Bitcoin has unique risk-return characteristics, follows a different volatility process when compared with other assets, and is uncorrelated with other assets. Hence, Bitcoin’s excess returns and volatility have somewhat resembled a more speculative asset than gold or the U.S. dollar (Baur et al., 2018 ). The volatility of Bitcoin is extreme, and the prices fluctuate considerably over longer horizons and daily (Bariviera, 2017 ; Baur & Hoang, 2021 ). Bitcoin is about eight times more volatile than the stock market and close to 20 times more volatile than the U.S. dollar (Harvey, 2018 ). In this scenario, this statement of Harvey is significant, “finance, as we know it today, will be disrupted shortly; indeed, Bitcoins are the beginning of this disruption”. Kraaijeveld and Smedt ( 2020 ), Wołk ( 2019 ), Pano and Kashef ( 2020 ), and Price and Burnie ( 2019 )are of the opinion that the volatility of the cryptocurrency market is attributed to news, messages, and posts on social media. Since cryptocurrency is one of the new-age currencies, investors are more reliant on social media for speedy information than conventional media. Several authors such as Shen et al. ( 2019 ), Colianni et al. ( 2015 ), Pano and Kashef ( 2020 ), Kraaijeveld and Smedt ( 2020 ) etc., have examined the link between investor attention, Bitcoin returns, and its trading volume. Their sentiments analysis revealed the volatility by employing posts from Twitter as a measure of attention rather than Google Trends. The frequency and direction of tweets is a significant driver of next-day trading volume and realized volatility, further supported by linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests. Considering these facts, investor sentiments, emotions, and behavioural bias could be significant factors in the price movement of cryptocurrencies. 3.4 Status of qualitative research approach in Bitcoin market research Qualitative analysis is not seen much in Bitcoin literature, even though investors think beyond the logic of theories while investing. During this pandemic situation of COVID-19, since everybody is panicking about the uncertain future, the influence of investors’ fear sentiment on Bitcoin price dynamics is unpredictable. Chen et al. ( 2020 ) and Ali et al. ( 2020 ) observed that during the period of market distress, Bitcoin behaves like traditional financial assets such as gold. Hence, this conceptualisation may not be desirable for investors to allocate resources to Bitcoin to reduce risk exposure. The actual BTC market has not served as a haven during the pandemic. However, the price of Bitcoin is mainly driven by investors’ interest in cryptocurrency and not by macroeconomic fundamentals or financial ratios (Kristoufek, 2018 ). Gurdgiev and O’Loughlin ( 2020 ) examined price dynamics of cryptocurrencies and found that they are influenced by the interaction between behavioural factors behind investor decisions and publicly accessible data flows. In this background, conducting a sentimental analysis is useful to understand the influence and direction of investor sentiment on the price direction of the BTC market. 3.4.1 Sentimental effect of Bitcoin prices Sentiment analysis is the act of extracting and measuring the subjective emotions or opinions expressed in the text (Abraham et al., 2018 ). Its purpose is to conduct opinion mining to determine the writer’s attitude towards a particular item (Vijayaragavan et al., 2020 ). Recent sentiment analysis algorithms can detect positive and negative emotion strength in short informal texts with a reasonable degree of success (Dang-Xuan et al., 2013 ). Investors also use social media for posting their views, opinions, and feelings. Behavioral sciences and related scientific literature have investigated evidence of the relationship between social media and cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Apart from conventional social media such as Facebook and Twitter, several cryptocurrency forums such as ADVFN, Moon forum, Blackhat world, Bitcointalk, Crypto compare etc. are influencing the market in a significant manner. “Bitcointalk” is divided into several sections such as Bitcoin discussion, coin mining, technical help, and Bitcoin economics, where investors can share their views (Jawaheri et al., 2020 ). These social media and investors’ forums are to be examined by academicians for providing practical insights to the investors through sentimental analytics (Fernández Vilas et al., 2021 ). The public uses Google as a search engine; thereby, Google can give insight into people’s interests, and it can provide that search data in the format of ‘Google Trends’. Abraham et al. ( 2018 ) and Urquhart ( 2018 ) found that previous day price volatility and search volume in Google Trends are significant drivers of attention of Bitcoin. Previous studies show a connection between Bitcoin price and the sentiment of the public. This is evident in the study of Ahn and Kim ( 2020 )who found that returns on Bitcoin, trading volume, volatility, and signed jump variations are all strongly linked to investor dissatisfaction. Chen et al. ( 2020 ) learned that the Bitcoin price had been influenced by the Corona virus outbreak, and it gives a clear picture that fear sentiment can affect the Bitcoin price dynamics. Ahn and Kim ( 2020 ) attempted to establish a relationship between sentimental aspects and Bitcoin price volatility, but they took only two variables into consideration: attention and disagreement. Moreover, they ignored other behavioural factors and emotions. 3.5 Herding behaviour and Bitcoin price Poyser ( 2019 ) argued that the price of Bitcoin has never been stagnant since its inception. The price reached the level of $60,000, but then saw a sudden fall to $30,000 during the period of May 2020. If we analyse the market trend, we can understand that the market nowadays is heavily reliant upon sentiments, behavioural biases, and emotions. These ups and downs of price are majorly due to the tweets and comments of some influential personalities such as Elon Musk, the CEO of Space X and Tesla. It is a clear example of herding bias and sentimental effect. Chen et al. ( 2020 ) considered only the fear sentiment and the Bitcoin price in assessing the price dynamics. The influence of personalities such as Elon Musk who have millions of followers on Twitter and other social media platforms was not considered. It is clear from recent events that their tweets and posts do have a significant influence on the trading trend, volume, and price of cryptocurrencies. Elon Musk had tweeted in February 2021 about Bitcoin, which created a remarkable hike in its price. In May 2021, he tweeted about Dogecoin, another cryptocurrency, which influenced people to sell Bitcoin and invest in Dogecoin instead for a while. This shows how sentiments and emotions impact the BTC price. 4 Objectives and evolving of research questions This study is a mix of both quantitative and qualitative methods of research. It focuses on quantifying the relationship of Bitcoin prices with investor sentiments from 2016 onwards and analysing the correlation between the two. The study also goes deep into the reasons behind the price volatility by comparing the qualitative and quantitative data related to Bitcoin prices. The researchers explain the futuristic view of the BTC market by analysing the sentiments, emotions, and activities on the Bitcointalk forum and Google Trends. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons of Bitcoin price is a novel aspect that differentiates our study from previous ones. The present study sheds light on the following research questions. 1. Are Bitcoins fairly priced, overpriced or under-priced? 2. Do sentiments play a significant role in Bitcoin price movements? 3. Is Bitcoin overpriced due to market sentiments? 4. Is there any similarity found when we compare qualitative and quantitative data of BTC prices? 5. Do the biases of the investors dominate the Bitcoin market? 6. Do the tweets of famous individuals influence market trends? 5 Research methodology A triangulation approach is considered suitable for blended research (Noble & Heale, 2019 ). This would increase the credibility and validity of research findings. For conducting qualitative analysis, data were captured from Bitcointalk—a Bitcoin forum. It is the most popular Bitcoin forum with more than 9,00,000 users who exchange interests, technical expertise, and experiences in developing Bitcoin (Jawaheri et al., 2020 ). It offers credible resources that guarantee a convenient volume for sentimental analytics (Fernández Vilas et al., 2021 ). 5.1 Data and software We examined posts written regarding Bitcoin for 5 years from 2016 to 2021 on Bitcointalk forum. The data collection process focused on gathering a set of posts for the summated keywords \" Bitcoin\", ‘“Collapse’’, ‘“Crash’’, ‘’Drop’’, ‘“Fear’’, ‘“Fluctuate’’, ‘“Fraud’’, ’“Greed’’, ‘““Instability’’, ‘“Manipulation’’, ‘“Pessimistic’’, ‘““Price fall’’, ‘“Risk’’, ‘““Slash’’, and ‘““Uncertainty’’. We collected 6 years’ worth of data with the search term “Bitcoin Crash’ ’to analyse investors’ sentiments. For supporting the sentimental analysis, data from Google Trends on the Bitcoin price for 6 years from 2016 to 2021 were also used. In addition to this, we used the market data of Bitcoin to capture the effect of Bitcoin market trends and growth. NVivo software has been used for sentimental analytics and the data visualization was done with the aid of Tableau software. NVivo allows the researcher to interrogate data at a particular level (Zamawe, 2015 ). Its word frequency results demonstrated a perfect fit with the social-tagging network analysis, which is an additional advantage of this software for qualitative research. 6 Results and discussion The available theoretical literature speaks about the sentimental analysis of Bitcoin prices. Most of the articles reveal that there is a clear relationship between the volume of tweets and the market trends. Bollen et al. ( 2011 ) demonstrated that tweets could predict the market trend 3–4 days in advance with a good chance of success. Apart from tweets, the discussions in Bitcoin forums also play a significant role in Bitcoin’s price changes (Fernández Vilas et al., 2021 ). We analyzed Bitcoin price behaviour by comparing its variations with the number of posts in Bitcoin forums, particularly from Bitcointalk with Google Trends results. We considered whether there is any relationship between posts in Bitcointalk and the Bitcoin market price changes. The influence of the frequency of Google searches on Bitcoin’s price movements was also studied. Furthermore, this research compares the effect of posts with negative and positive emotions on the Bitcoin market, which has never been dealt with in crypto academic literature. The results of sentiments analysis show that Google Trends and Bitcoin forum posts were highly correlated with Bitcoin market prices. We also found a strong causal relationship between Bitcoin prices and the searches of the investors. More importantly, we found that this causal relationship is bidirectional, i.e., the search queries influence the prices and vice versa. The reasons for the insights are related to the findings by Kristoufek ( 2013 ), who argued that speculation and trend-chasing dominate the Bitcoin price dynamics. When prices are moving above trend, the increased interest pushes the prices further. However, if the prices are below the trend, the growing bearish sentiments pulls the prices. These push and pull factors form an environment suitable for frequent sentimental behavior. This sentimental behaviour of investors is critical to predict the market. 6.1 Sentiments analysis of the Bitcointalk forum The activity of the Bitcointalk forum has a direct relationship with the trend in the values of BTC (Fernández Vilas et al., 2021 ). The research demonstrates how chatter on Bitcointalk reflects the sentiments of users. For evaluating investors’ positive and negative opinions, data were captured from Bitcointalk discussions during the period 2016–2021 using various keywords. Table 1 reports the sentiments of forum users and their corresponding reactions. Several terms were used for searching about Bitcoin in Bitcointalk. When we captured these posts using the NVivo extension, it was found that “Bitcoin price” is the most popular search term used in Bitcointalk. Out of 1558 comments captured using 14 negative keywords, 365 have been coded as very negative, 884 as moderately negative, 248 as moderately positive and 61 as very positive. For instance, “collapse” is the search keyword treated as a very negative sentiment by 21% of forum users, moderately negative by 68% and moderately positive by 11%. Almost 89% of forum users thus have a negative sentiment regarding the keyword “collapse” and only 11% of users have positive sentiments. Hence, the negative sentiments led the market of BTC during the experimental time of our research. Similarly, the forum users were assessed on other search keywords such as “crash”, “drop”, “fear”, “fluctuate”, “fraud”, “greed”, “instability”, “manipulation”, “pessimistic”, and “price fall” (For more details see Table 1 ). Table 1 Classifications of sentiments by the Bitcointalk users Full size table The overall average of negative sentiments was78.25% and the overall average of positive sentiments was 21.75%. Moreover, we found that the real BTC market reacted according to the Bitcointalk forum’s attitude. The details of sentiments and the diagram to support the research arguments are exhibited in Table 1 and Fig. 1 , respectively. The research findings support the theory of Vilas et al. (2021) that the activities and discussions held in the Bitcointalk influence the BTC market. Hence, we can unequivocally conclude that the Bitcoin forums and communities have a strong role in influencing the Bitcoin market prices. Fig. 1 Analysis of average sentiments of BTC investors in Bitcointalk. The average sentiments of comments have been plotted in the graph and show that 5.40% sentiments are very positive, 16.32% sentiments are moderately positive, 56.21% are moderately negative and 22.04% are very negative Full size image 6.2 Long-run matching of BTC market prices and investor sentiments: Relationship between Google Trends and the BTC market during the period 2016–2021 The study examined the link between the Google Trends search frequency and the BTC market. We noticed that peaks in the search keyword “Bitcoin price crash” in Google search resulted in a fall in price in the BTC market. Figures 2 and 3 exhibit a relationship between the two time series data sets. A significant peak of the search query ‘’Bitcoin crash’’ on Google Trends on 17 December 2017 was followed by a horrific crash of Bitcoin’s price. Its impact was visible in the following days: on 17 December 2017, the price of Bitcoin had been $19,783.06 and it dropped to $13,800 on 22 December 2017. The reason for this fall in price was clearly due to the emotions of investors. In addition, the launch of Bitcoin Futures helped to burst the bubble. The price of Bitcoin began to crash only a few days after the introduction of Bitcoin Futures on 11 December 2017 and suffered an 80% loss in the next year (Liu et al., 2020 ). Figures 2 and 3 report the price variation of the BTC market during 2016–2021 and “Bitcoin” search frequency in Google Trends during 2016–2021. We can find a similar result in the two diagrams. In other words, the prices in the BTC market and search frequencies in Google Trends are close matches. This means that the BTC market is guided by the investors’ emotions. As soon as news spreads, the investors start searching for the same in Google and take decisions accordingly. The search in Google Trends directly impacted the BTC market decision of whether to buy or sell. In short, the investors’ decision to buy or sell Bitcoin depends on the results of their Google searches. Thus, we can conclude that the ups and downs of the BTC market are determined solely by investors’ sentiments rather than economic and financial theories.

The impact of investor sentiments on the Bitcoin price is visible in Fig. 4 . The search results for ‘’Bitcoin crash’’ were highest on 16 May 2021, followed by a Bitcoin price crash to $38,249 on 24 May 2021 from $49,764 on 16 May 2021 in the BTC market. This crash is visible in Fig. 5 . We can find a similar positioning in both diagrams, i.e., plotting of the Google Trends and the BTC market. In Fig. 4 , the diagrammatic presentation of Google Trends search query representation is matched with the actual BTC market position exhibited in Fig. 5 . The fluctuations of both the diagram are a close match. If the BTC market prices were moving up, the same direction is visible in the Google Trends search frequency volume and vice versa. Fig. 4 Price variation of Bitcoin during 2020–2021. Note : Illustrates the price variation of BTC during the years 2020–2021 Full size image Fig. 5 Search frequency of “Bitcoin” in Google Trends during 2020–2021. Illustrates the price variation of Bitcoin and Google Trends results in the years 2020–2021 Full size image Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 support the assertion that sentiments and emotions play a very big role in the BTC market. The reason behind the Bitcoin crash during the month of May 2021 is purely due to the negative tweet of Elon Musk regarding Bitcoin, which made the investors panic and the demand for the Bitcoin dropped. Thus, it can be conclusively asserted that sentiments play a significant role in the demand and price of Bitcoin. Hence, we can conclude that the Bitcoin price is determined by market demand and not fundamental and technical variables. 7 Conclusions This study has investigated the price volatility of Bitcoin both in the long run and the short term. We have made a comparison of both quantitative and qualitative analyses of Bitcoin price movements of both periods. This paper provides new insights regarding the causal direction between investor attention to Bitcoin and its price variations. We maintain that there is a strong causal relationship between the prices and search terms. Most importantly, this relationship is bidirectional, i.e., the search queries influence the prices, and the prices affect the search queries. Since the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is zero, the investors cannot tell whether it is reasonably priced, overpriced or under-priced. The market forces determine the price of Bitcoin. It has also been observed that there is no face value or book value associated with Bitcoin. Hence, the investors are confused regarding the real value of Bitcoin. We were able to prove that investor sentiments and emotions are the pivot factors that determine the market prices of Bitcoin. The knowledge realised from the literature tells us that there is an artificial investment intention in the form of digital nudges playing the field of the Bitcoin market (Mirsch et al., 2017 ). Our data analysis proved that this syndrome causes Bitcoin to be overpriced. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Clubhouse, and other social media groups that promote Bitcoin add to the creation of price bubbles. Across match has been found between quantitative trends on the Bitcoin market prices and qualitative matrices used such as Bitcointalk and Google Trends. The reason for this cross match is the cashing of investor sentiments in the market. We found that the biases of investors have influenced the Bitcoin market positively or negatively. Positive sentiments led to positive tweets, and as a reflection of the tweets the market shot up. On the other hand, negative sentiments have led to negative tweets, and the market went down. Even though money is being pumped into the crypto market, the majority of investors are doubtful about the future of the BTC market. The reason for this might be the influence of Warren Buffet and Paul Krugman who are very critical of the future of the BTC market. 8 Policy implications We have noted that in the past six months, the top three crypto exchanges Wazirx, Coins witch Kuber and Coin DCX have blocked over two lakh accounts citing malicious activities such as tax evasion. News of other crypto currency frauds were reported from countries including the US, UK, France, Austria, Switzerland, and Germany. The biggest crisis faced by the regulators in the BTC market is that of people buying Bitcoins on one platform and sending it to unknown addresses. None have been successful in tracking down these unknown addresses. Even the crypto exchanges are unable to track them. The real issue behind all these crises is the lack of proper regulation. The crypto world is manipulated by a few select people in the world through their tweets and posts rather than the fundamentals of the BTC market. Recently, the BTC market is moving opposite of the other second generation and third generation cryptos. The prediction of the market using the theories are very difficult in crypt investment due to lack of fundamentals. At the outset, we would like to recommend that all national governments should draw up effective regulations to protect this investment avenue and to make it as investor friendly as possible. If the crypto market is allowed to move along with other financial markets, its spill over effects may influence stock and derivative market indices. We found some academic literature on this phenomenon. More studies on this aspect will be an asset to crypto literature and beneficial to investors and governments alike.

Our data shows traders are now at their least net-long Bitcoin since Jan 02 when Bitcoin traded near 32,175.37. The number of traders net-long is 1.48% lower than yesterday and 8.33% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 7.73% higher than yesterday and 16.20% higher from last week. We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Bitcoin prices may continue to fall. Yet traders are less net-long than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current Bitcoin price trend may soon reverse higher despite the fact traders remain net-long.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Points At Neutral Trader Sentiment The “ Fear & Greed Index ” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency sector. According to the index’s creator, Alternative , the metric takes into account multiple factors for calculating this sentiment. The five factors it currently uses in the indicator’s value are namely: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends data. Earlier, the index also made use of surveys, but for now, they are on pause. To represent the market sentiment, the fear and greed index uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100. All values above the 54 mark suggest greed among the traders, while values below 46 imply fear. The in-between region means the presence of a neutral mentality. Besides these three basic sentiments, there are also two extreme sentiments, called “extreme fear” (taking place below 25) and “extreme greed” (occurring above 75). Historically, these two regions have been quite significant for Bitcoin, as cyclical bottoms and tops have usually formed in the respective zones.

Although, at the current 52 value, the metric is certainly closer to the greed territory than the fear one. Earlier in the month, when BTC witnessed a crash from the $29,000 level to below the $26,000 mark, the sentiment in the market naturally plummeted. Investors had become fearful and had remained so for the duration that the asset consolidated around these lows. After the rally spurred by Grayscale’s lawsuit victory , though, the sentiment rapidly registered an improvement and surged toward the current neutral values. The below chart represents how the Fear & Greed Index’s value has changed recently: Looks like the indicator's value has observed a sharp uplift in recent days | Source: Alternative While the sentiment in the market has seen a rapid improvement with the latest rally, the investors haven’t quite yet made up their minds if they want to give in to greed or not.

Nevertheless, a break into the greed territory would naturally be a green signal for any surge’s sustainability, as it would mean that the majority of the investors are ready to support the move. BTC Price After observing a pullback since the rally high, Bitcoin is currently trading around the $27,200 level, with investors still enjoying profits of about 3% over the past week.

ETH / BTC jumps higher giving the alt-coin market a positive backdrop. Recommended by                    Nick Cawley Get Your Free Bitcoin Forecast Get My Guide Bitcoin has broken higher over the last 24 hours and is testing a prior resistance level around $20.475k that has weighed on BTC over the 10 weeks. The recent break, and confirmation, of the medium-term downtrend, have helped to drive the move after BTCUSD got stuck in a multi-month sideways range. I noted the break and reason for optimism earlier this month: Bitcoin (BTC) Latest: A False Break or a Reason to be Optimistic While the recent move higher may have more room to run higher, it will need to break through a recent zone between $22.8k and $25.2k. A confirmed break through this zone would also take out the last two lower highs and the last of the three simple moving averages, the 200-dsma. This would change Bitcoin’s outlook to positive and leave further upside on the cards. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Price Chart – October 26, 2022 Chart via TradingView While the technical outlook may be starting to turn, the fundamental outlook may still weigh on Bitcoin. US interest rates will be raised by 75 basis points at the next FOMC meeting, and nearly certainly by the same amount again at the December meeting, keeping the macro environment negative. Saying that yesterday saw the Nasdaq and Bitcoin diverge, giving the crypto-bulls more reason to be cheerful. Higher interest rates weigh on the Nasdaq. The second-largest coin by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is also running higher and is out-performing Bitcoin over the last week. The ETH/BTC spread is seen by some as a marker for alt-coin performance with a rallying spread leading to higher alt-coin prices and a potential to outperform Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC spread is now back above all three simple moving averages and a potential ‘golden cross’ is being formed. This set-up, when the 50-day sma moves above the 200-day sma, is seen by many as a bullish signal.

Contact us Abstract Purpose Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) attracted a lot of attention in recent months due to their unprecedented price fluctuations. This paper aims to propose a new method for predicting the direction of BTC price using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) together with sentiment analysis. Design/methodology/approach Concretely, the authors train an LDA-based classifier that uses the current BTC price information and BTC news announcements headlines to forecast the next-day direction of BTC prices. The authors compare the results with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and random guess approach. The use of BTC price information and news announcements related to crypto enables us to value the importance of these different sources and types of information. Findings Relative to the LDA results, the SVM model was more accurate in predicting BTC next day’s price movement. All models yielded better forecasts of an increase in tomorrow’s BTC price compared to forecasting a decrease in the crypto price. The inclusion of news sentiment resulted in the highest forecast accuracy of 0.585 on the test data, which is superior to a random guess. The LDA (SVM) model with asset specific (news sentiment and asset specific) input features ranked first within their respective model classifiers, suggesting both BTC news sentiment and asset specific are prized factors in predicting tomorrow’s price direction. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the potential effect of crypto-related sentiment and BTC specific news on BTC’s price using LDA and sentiment analysis.

       "  'text': 'Crypto Fear & Greed Index - Bitcoin Sentiment - Alternative.me Home Crypto Fear & Greed Index Crypto Fear & Greed Index Each day, we analyze emotions and sentiments from different sources and crunch them into one simple number: The Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies. Historical Values Now Fear 45 Yesterday Neutral 47 Last week Neutral 48 Last month Fear 30 Next Update The next update will happen in: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Over Time This is a plot of the Fear & Greed Index over time, where a value of 0 means \"Extreme Fear\" while a value of 100 represents \"Extreme Greed\". 7 days 1 month 3 month 1 year max Why Measure Fear and Greed? The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With our Fear and Greed Index, we try to save you from your own emotional overreactions. There are two simple assumptions: Extreme fear can be a sign that investors are too worried. That could be a buying opportunity . When Investors are getting too greedy , that means the market is due for a correction . Therefore, we analyze the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market and crunch the numbers into a simple meter from 0 to 100. Zero means \"Extreme Fear\", while 100 means \"Extreme Greed\". See below for further information on our data sources. Data Sources We are gathering data from the five following sources. Each data point is valued the same as the day before in order to visualize a meaningful progress in sentiment change of the crypto market. First of all, the current index is for bitcoin only (we offer separate indices for large alt coins soon), because a big part of it is the volatility of the coin price. But let’s list all the different factors we’re including in the current index: Volatility (25 %) We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days. We argue that an unusual rise in volatility is a sign of a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day average values) and put those two values together. Generally, when we see high buying volumes in a positive market on a daily basis, we conclude that the market acts overly greedy / too bullish. Social Media (15%) While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index (we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames). A unusual high interaction rate results in a grown public interest in the coin and in our eyes, corresponds to a greedy market behaviour. Surveys (15%) currently paused Together with strawpoll.com (disclaimer: we own this site, too), quite a large public polling platform, we’re conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market. Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors. We don’t give those results too much attention, but it was quite useful in the beginning of our studies. You can see some recent results here . Dominance (10%) The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull run. Anyhow, analyzing the dominance for a coin other than Bitcoin, you could argue the other way round, since more interest in an alt-coin may conclude a bullish/greedy behaviour for that specific coin. Trends (10%) We pull Google Trends data for various Bitcoin related search queries and crunch those numbers, especially the change of search volumes as well as recommended other currently popular searches. For example, if you check Google Trends for \"Bitcoin\" , you can’t get much information from the search volume. But currently, you can see that there is currently a +1,550% rise of the query „bitcoin price manipulation“ in the box of related search queries (as of 05/29/2018). This is clearly a sign of fear in the market, and we use that for our index. Share & Embed Feel free to share or embed our Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index image widget.

       "  'text': \"Crypto Fear and Greed Index - Bitcoin Momentum Tracker Home Learning Hub Crypto Fear and Greed Index - Bitcoin Momentum Tracker Intermediate Series Crypto Fear and Greed Index - Bitcoin Momentum Tracker The Crypto Fear and Greed Index provides a score of 0 to 100, categorising bitcoin sentiment from extreme fear to extreme greed. Many crypto traders use the index to help them find the right time to enter and exit the market. In this guide, we cover everything from how it works to how you can use it to help you trade. Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Live What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index uses social signals and market trends to determine the overall sentiment of the crypto market, based on bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies . It’s called an index because it takes multiple data sources and combines them into a single figure. The index is divided into the following four categories: 0-24: Extreme fear (orange) 25-49: Fear (amber/yellow) 50-74: Greed (light green) 75-100: Extreme greed (green) How to use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? As you’re probably well aware, the crypto market can be volatile at times. This is in part due to emotional investors reacting to the market. People can feel FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and get greedy when the market is rising. They also can become fearful when the market is falling and sell their coins. Many traders use the index as a market indicator, a tool that gives them information about the market to help them trade smarter. Analysing the overall sentiment and the emotions driving the market has helped many traders outperform the market. Here’s how the creators of the index suggest it can be used to help you trade: Extreme fear could be a buying opportunity because investors are too worried. Extreme greed could mean that investors are too greedy and the market is due for a correction. How is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated by Alternate.me using a range of sources: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media, dominance, and trends. Surveys have also been used in the past, but are currently paused. Also, the signals are based on bitcoin , but other large cryptos like ethereum may be incorporated into the index soon. Here’s a closer look at each of the five key signals: Volatility - A rise in volatility is used as a sign of a fearful market. Market momentum/volume - The current market momentum is compared to the current volume. When buying volumes are outpacing the longer term momentum, it signals the market is getting too greedy. Social media - Using a Twitter sentiment analysis tool, an unusually high interaction rate is used to identify greedy market behaviour. Dominance - A rise in bitcoin dominance is considered a sign of a fearful market moving to a safer asset, while a fall in bitcoin dominance is seen as a sign the market is getting too greedy and moving to more speculative altcoins. Trends - Data from Google Trends is used to see how many people are searching for information about bitcoin. An increase in certain search terms such as ‘bitcoin price manipulation’ is considered a fearful signal, while ‘bitcoin price prediction’ would be considered more bullish. Insights from the Crypto Fear and Greed Index This historical chart of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from BTC Tools. It shows us how bitcoin sentiment has changed over the longer term, specifically from June 2019 to October 2020. As you can see, the index generally sits in the greed range and rarely drops into extreme fear for more than a month. It also shows us bitcoin sentiment has correlated with major events in crypto over the past two years. We can see that the index hit its lowest point in March 2020, as panic about the coronavirus spread and both financial markets and the crypto markets sold off, including Ethereum, Litecoin, Terra, and Ripple. Notably, it hit its highest point in February 2021 following the run from AU$10,000 to AU$50,000. That period also coincided with the massive profit opportunities of ‘DeFi summer’. As you can see, it stayed there for over a month before news of China’s mining ban broke and it dropped precipitously. At a broader level, this chart reveals two important things about the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. Firstly, it can change incredibly rapidly as news breaks or prices slide. Secondly, it can stay in the greed and extreme greed levels for extended periods. Overall, it shows that bitcoin’s sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive for the past two years. Is it a short-term or long-term indicator? As you can see from the historical chart, the Crypto Fear and Greed Indicator doesn’t correspond tightly to longer-term bull runs. Rather, it reacts to news events and short-term changes in the crypto market. For those reasons, many traders use it primarily as a short-term indicator rather than as a long-term indicator. As you might expect, it's especially popular among traders. How can I control my own emotions when investing? Looking at the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, we can see how the overall market can behave irrationally in the short term. As individual investors, we ask ourselves, how can I control my emotions and not let greed or fear drive my investing decisions? Here are some strategies that many traders use to manage their emotions when making decisions: 1. Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful Many traders use the index as a way to follow Warren Buffett’s aphorism of being “greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Pay attention to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to see if you’re getting caught up in the emotions of the digital currency market. Morgan Stanley has advised readers to “Tune out irrelevant information and noise, and resist the urge to follow the crowd.” 2. Use the dollar cost averaging investment strategy Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a popular investment strategy in the cryptocurrency industry because it helps remove emotions from investing. The strategy involves making regular small investments over time, rather than trying to time the market with one big investment. 3. Diversify Analysts from the investment bank Morgan Stanley recommend that investors “Develop a strategy that diversifies your investments across different asset classes and investment vehicles to minimise systemic and asset-specific risk.” They see this as a way to help manage your emotional response during market volatility. Did you know that CNNMoney inspired the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? The finance channel CNNMoney originally developed a Fear and Greed Index for stocks. It looked at how far several indicators had deviated from their averages to give the stock market an overall rating between 0 and 100. While the Crypto Fear and Greed Index uses different indicators, the idea was certainly inspired by CNN. Where can I access the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? Many traders check this indicator daily as it gives them a quick sense of the market. When it hits extreme greed or extreme fear, they often take it as a signal to look at all of the trading signals more closely. They most often check financial metrics like supply and demand or market capitalisation and sometimes dive deeper with on-chain indicators .

Yet the state-of-the-art is limited to predicting the price direction and not the magnitude of increase/decrease. In this paper, we seek to build on the state-of-the-art to not only predict the direction yet to also predict the magnitude of increase/decrease. We utilise not only sentiment extracted from tweets, but also the volume of tweets. We present results from experiments exploring the relation between sentiment and future price at different temporal granularities, with the goal of discovering the optimal time interval at which the sentiment expressed becomes a reliable indicator of price change. Two different neural network models are explored and evaluated, one based on recurrent nets and one based on convolutional networks. An additional model is presented to predict the magnitude of change, which is framed as a multi-class classification problem. It is shown that this model yields more reliable predictions when used alongside a price trend prediction model. The main research contribution from this paper is that we demonstrate that not only can price direction prediction be made but the magnitude in price change can be predicted with relative accuracy (\\xa063%). Introduction Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2009 ) has, since its introduction in 2008/9, attracted extensive attention for various reasons from different stakeholders with varying opinions regarding its utility and potential. Despite the fact that it and its underlying\\xa0blockchain technology have been declared ‘dead’ on a number of occations, Footnote 1 recent all-time high prices Footnote 2 and research indicates otherwise (Ellul 2021 ). Given that such opinions may and do sway potential investors’ interest, it is desirable to investigate whether better methods could be developed to support investors. In fact, not only could public opinion sway potential investors’ interest, the same public sentiment could be used to empower investors to make better informed decisions regarding future price predictions. There is no doubt that sentiment affects an asset’s price—and as put by Baker and Wurgler: “the question is no longer, as it was a few decades ago, whether investor sentiment affects stock prices, but rather how to measure investor sentiment and quantify its effects” (Baker and Wurgler 2007 ). Whilst this statement is referring to a well-founded body of literature on applying sentiment analysis to traditional markets (Gunter et\\xa0al. 2014 ; Rao and Srivastava 2012 ; Li et\\xa0al. 2014 ; Mittal and Goel 2012 ), sentiment analysis can similarly be used for cryptocurrency price prediction as demonstrated extensively in recent work (Valencia et\\xa0al. 2019 ; Kraaijeveld and De Smedt 2020 ; Abraham et\\xa0al. 2018 ; Stenqvist and Lönnö 2017 ; Pant 2018 ; Galeshchuk et\\xa0al. 2018 ; Kilimci 2020 ; Naeem et\\xa0al. 2020 ; Serafini et\\xa0al. 2020 ; Wołk 2019 ; Balfagih and Keselj 2019 ; Mohapatra et\\xa0al. 2020 ). Twitter Footnote 3 is widely-used as a source of sentiment data, and has become a popular social media platform amongst crypto-communities (Kraaijeveld and De Smedt 2020 ; Abraham et\\xa0al. 2018 ; Stenqvist and Lönnö 2017 ; Pant 2018 ; Galeshchuk et\\xa0al. 2018 ; Kilimci 2020 ; Naeem et\\xa0al. 2020 ; Balfagih and Keselj 2019 ; Mohapatra et\\xa0al. 2020 ). Whilst the current state-of-the-art has achieved encouraging results, yet further research effort is required to overcome a number of issues. Many of these following issues are frequently encountered in price prediction models based on sentiment analysis of Twitter data: (i) evaluation is typically based on minimal historical data (Pant 2018 ; Valencia et\\xa0al. 2019 ; Stenqvist and Lönnö 2017 ; Kilimci 2020 ); (ii) predictions tend to lag behind when the predicted prices are actually seen on the market (Serafini et\\xa0al. 2020 ; iii) models are frequently limited to the prediction of the direction (up or down) (Kilimci 2020 ; Valencia et\\xa0al. 2019 ; Galeshchuk et\\xa0al. 2018 ), though some studies have proposed to make predictions of exact prices with limited success (Pant 2018 ; Li and Dai 2020 ; Serafini et\\xa0al. 2020 ). Some of the issues described above may be due to the following particular challenges. The direction of price change and magnitude is often non-linear, and therefore not straightforward to solve (Kimoto et\\xa0al. 1990 ). Furthermore, tweets are often duplicated for marketing purposes and may also be automated by tweet bots (Valencia et\\xa0al. 2019 ). Tweets also typically contain features that result in noise (when it comes to sentiment analysis) including hashtags, profile mentions and URLs (Kraaijeveld and De Smedt 2020 ). At the same time, the use of sarcasm in tweets could skew sentiment predictions (Rosenthal et\\xa0al. 2014 ). Therefore, prior to tackling the general problem of extracting sentiment, pre-processing of tweets should be undertaken to reduce such noise. In this paper, we investigate predicting the magnitude of price change (beyond just the direction) and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper proposed to do so. We present exhaustive evaluation and conclusive results for a number of models. Furthermore, the models proposed overcome the late prediction problem see in the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we investigate the predictive relationship between Twitter sentiment and associated price changes as a function of different time lags. Through this we thereby address the question of which temporal interval between expressed sentiment and price change provides the best results. An in-depth study was undertaken to determine how different types of neural networks and features used may affect accuracy, in which each model investigated was evaluated against different combinations of features used as well as against different time lags introduced between sentiment and price change. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. The following section gives an overview of sentinent analysis, followed by recent work on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency price prediction. Then the classification problems addressed, and the methods used for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the neural models we propose are presented. After which results are presented and discussed. Finally, then conclude with some directions for future work. Background on sentiment analysis In its raw form, natural language text is meaningless to a computer—nothing more than encoded bytes. Over the past decade strides have been made within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the aim of enabling computational systems to reason better about natural language. Sentiment analysis, as its name implies, analyses and extracts sentiment, opinion, subjectivity and polarity from text. Use-cases for sentiment analysis are plenty—including but not limited to product market analysis and automated flagging of positive/negative/potentially-harmful comments on websites and social media platforms. Since the introduction of Sentiment Analysis to the NLP community (Pang and Lee 2008 ), several techniques have been proposed to associate polarity with a piece of text. It can be framed as a classification problem, whereby a text segment is classified as positive, negative or neutral. Some approaches also assign a value reflecting the degree of confidence associated with the respective polarity. Lexicon-based approaches make use of a lexicon (a collection of words) and associated sentiment scores to compare with the text being classified to determine a final polarity score. One widely-used lexicon-based implementation, VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) (Hutto and Gilbert 2015 ), further makes use of rule-matching, which attempts to identify polarity based on the input text using linguistic patterns. VADER combines selected features from three validated lexicons Footnote 4 along with tweet intensity rules that were extracted from analysis of terms of syntax, grammar and valence values of 800 tweets (Stenqvist and Lönnö 2017 ). Sentiment analysis has over the past decade been extensively applied to Twitter data which indeed ‘poses newer and different challenges’ (Agarwal et\\xa0al. 2011 ) beyond those associated with more traditional sentiment analysis applications (Hussein 2018 ) and the wide range of approaches (Medhat et\\xa0al. 2014 ). Furthermore, the SemEval international workshop Footnote 5 helped facilitate further research by making available a set of shared challenges for the community. Particularly related to the context of this work, since the 2013 workshop (Nakov et\\xa0al. 2013 ) a shared task focused on Twitter sentiment analysis has been published every year. Related work on cryptocurrency price prediction We now provide an overview of approaches used in specifically the domain of cyrptocurrency price prediction. Further detail and a comparison with the state-of-the-art will be woven into the methodology and evaluation sections, in order to provide a direct comparison of relevant aspects. Attempts to predict Bitcoin price using Long Short Term Memory Cells (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and hybrid CNN-LSTM models without undertaking sentiment analysis were originally proposed (Li and Dai 2020 ; Livieris et\\xa0al. 2021 ; Kwon et\\xa0al. 2019 ). Initial work in investigating the use of sentiment analysis of Twitter data for price prediction was proposed by Pant ( 2018 ); Galeshchuk et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ) and Serafini et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ). To eliminate the vanishing gradient problem seen in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Pant ( 2018 ) proposed to make use of an RNN predictor with LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) variations. This work resulted in a moderate correlation between rising negative sentiment and consequent falling of prices. A comparison of LSTM and ARIMA model-based approaches were conducted in Serafini et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ), in which it is stated that the ARIMA model performs better. Further comparisons with other models and on different cryptocurrencies were further presented in Valencia et\\xa0al. ( 2019 ) and Wołk ( 2019 ). According to Valencia et\\xa0al. ( 2019 ), Twitter data is not sufficient to predict Bitcoin price on its own, but can help when combined with other market data. An overview of the related studies is presented in Table 1 . Table 1 Existing studies and models Full size table Fig. 1 An overview of the process undertaken to determine the best model and parameters to use. Full size image Methodology Figure 1 provides an overview of the process followed to determine the best model for predicting: (i) the next day’s close price direction (i.e. whether it will increase/decrease); and (ii) the magnitude of difference in closing prices. Two main datasets are used in this study: (i) Bitcoin price data; and (ii) Twitter tweets. Historical Bitcoin price data providing a per-minute record of timestamps, opening and closing prices, high and low prices and volume of Bitcoin traded for the period between 1st January 2012 and 31st December 2020 was retrieved from Kaggle. Footnote 6 A Twitter dataset Footnote 7 (also from Kaggle) was filtered to retrieve tweets that contained either ‘bitcoin’ or ‘btc’. The period of tweets provided in the dataset is between 1st January 2016 and 29th March 2019—including a total of over 20 million tweets. In addition to the text of each tweet, the dataset provides timestamps, tweet IDs and URLs, associated authors’ usernames and full names, and the number of replies, likes and retweets that tweets received. Fig. 2 Process to preprocess and clean tweets Full size image Data cleaning and pre-processing The following cleaning and pre-processing tasks depicted in Fig. 2 were undertaken on the Twitter dataset: Removal of non-English tweets Footnote 8 and duplicate tweets made by the same user in a similar manner to Pant ( 2018 ); Valencia et\\xa0al. ( 2019 ) and Ranjan et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ); Removal of URLs from tweets, as performed in Kraaijeveld and De Smedt ( 2020 ) and Ranjan et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ); Tokenization and lemmatization in a similar manner to Pagolu et\\xa0al. ( 2016 ) (that is, mapping each token to its morphological base form, so as to enable reasoning about words in a form-agnostic manner); Footnote 9 Removal of stop words (e.g. ’a’, ’the’, etc.), similarly to what was done by Pagolu et\\xa0al. ( 2016 ); Replacement of user mentions (akin to tagging, which takes the form of ‘@’ followed by the username) with the text ‘USER’, again following Pagolu et\\xa0al. ( 2016 ); Removal of all punctuation (Abraham et\\xa0al. 2018 ); Processing of hashtags: if the word following the hash sign was not found in a precompiled English wordlist Footnote 10 , it was removed; otherwise, the ’#’ sign was dropped and the word retained as was done by Kraaijeveld and De Smedt ( 2020 ); Removal of tweets containing fewer than 4 words, similarly to Kraaijeveld and De Smedt ( 2020 ); The normalised datasets are available from the repository we have made available to download from https://github.com/jacquesvcritien/fyp . In relation to the Bitcoin pricing dataset, the high and low prices were removed from the feature list so as to only keep the average price per minute Footnote 11 . After the the cleaning and pre-processing steps, this study ended up with tweets and prices ranging between 30th August 2018 and 23rd November 2019. A desirable property of the resulting dataset is that Bitcoin prices within the specified date range evinced both downward ($6500 to $3300 = -49%) and upward trends ($3300 to $11500 = +248%). Determining polarity scores Following preprocessing, VADER (Hutto and Gilbert 2015 ) is used to assign sentiment scores to tweets. Similar approaches are used by Valencia et\\xa0al. ( 2019 ); Abraham et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ) and Kraaijeveld and De Smedt ( 2020 ) Footnote 12 . VADER scores each tweet with a negative, positive, neutral and compound polarity score. The compound score is a sum of the individual sentiment scores, adjusted according to a set of rules and normalised to fall within the \\\\([-1,+1]\\\\) range. However, for the purposes of this study, only positive and negative polarity scores are included in the training and evaluation data sets. VADER was widely used in related work (Valencia et\\xa0al. 2019 ; Abraham et\\xa0al. 2018 ; Kraaijeveld and De Smedt 2020 ; Mohapatra et\\xa0al. 2020 ; Serafini et\\xa0al. 2020 ) and provides advantages including the following: it is open source and free; it is human validated and tuned for Twitter content (Valencia et\\xa0al. 2019 ); and it has also been shown to perform competitively with human annotators and has outperformed several benchmarks, especially on social media content (Hutto and Gilbert 2015 ). Merging datasets and introducing lag One of the research questions which this work aims to address is the optimal lag to consider that would enable the discovery of a relationship between Bitcoin-related tweets (and in particular the sentiment they express) and actual price change. Indeed, it is not certain that such tweets are the cause of the change in price. However in this work we investigate whether a potential correlation can be seen, and if so what the optimal time lag is (between tweets and the price being affected). This approach was similarly followed by (Stenqvist and Lönnö 2017 ) and (Balfagih and Keselj 2019 ), who explored lags ranging from minutes to hours. In contrast to these approaches, in this paper we investigate lag intervals of a number of days—to be exact, 1, 3 or 7 days. To illustrate, Fig. 3 depicts the effect of introducing a lag of 3 days on a dataset—where the original dataset is on the left, and the dataset with a lag introduced is on the right. From the lagged dataset (on the right) note how, as an example, Day 1’s score is associated with Day 4’s price—i.e. tweets from day 1 are being assumed to affect prices 3 days later (in this example). The reason for choosing to investigate lags of 1, 3 and 7 days is that since this study focuses on making a daily prediction, the minimum lag to be observed should be of at least 1 day. Thereafter it was decided to observe a granularity of a week. The choice of a 3-day lag represents an interval between these two extremes. The three different lagged datasets (for 1-, 3- and 7-day lags) were created by shifting the price data (of the cleaned and merged dataset) back by the respective number of days in the lag being tested. Fig. 3 Lagged dataset example with lag 3 Full size image Grouping lagged datasets Lagged datasets consist of preprocessed tweets coupled with their Bitcoin price at the minute the tweet was posted. Subsequently, these are grouped by day in order to allow a model to make daily predictions. Grouping is done in the following manner: Timestamps of tweets are floored to the hour or day when the tweet was posted; Tweets are grouped by their floored timestamp; For a given group, the polarity scores are averaged; The tweet volume is added as an additional feature, where the volume is the number of tweets in a given day; The closing Bitcoin price for the day is then identified as the price for the last record for the given day. Features and labels The classifiers described below are trained to predict a fluctuation in price based on the following features: 1 Change : Bitcoin price change direction of that day (binary, indicating whether the price rises or falls); 2 Close : Bitcoin’s closing price for that day; 3 Positive polarity : The positive polarity score obtained from VADER; 4 Negative polarity : The negative polarity score obtained from VADER; 5 Tweet Volume : The volume of tweets in the relevant interval. This was also investigated in Abraham et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ) which demonstrated that prince changes were highly correlated with tweet volume. Table 2 Hyperparameters for the best models for predicting price direction DBMLA - Difference between Maximum and Lowest Accuracies Full size table Note that lagged datasets also include the above features for the previous days. For example, as shown in Fig. 4 , if the lag is 2, a training instance would include data from the last 2 days. Finally, the label of that instance would be the price change direction of the day following the last lagged feature. Fig. 4 Dataset with lagging features of 2 Full size image Data split and resampling In order to train and test the data, the dataset was split using a train-test ratio of 85:15. The reason for this is because of the small number of records available for training and testing after grouping and averaging the original datasets per day. Therefore, such a split allows the model to have a good percentage of the available data to train on while also having a fair number of records to test. When testing different models and parameters, each set of parameters is tested on 3 different shuffled datasets. However, when shuffling the dataset, the same seed is set to ensure that each model and set of parameters is tested on the same three sets of datasets, allowing for a fair comparison. The training and test sets are prepared by first shuffling the original datasets and then using the first 85% as the training set and the last 15% as the test set. Predicting next day’s close price direction The direction of the closing price can be framed as a binary classification problem where, given the input corresponding to features extracted from tweets, the task is to predict whether the price will go up or down. Three different models, (i) using an LSTM, (ii) CNN and (iii) Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Cells (BiLSTM), were implemented for predicting whether the following day’s closing price will increase or decrease. These are hereafter referred to as Direction-LSTM, Direction-CNN and Direction-BiLSTM. Table 2 outlines the hyperparameters used for each model. The table also gives the accuracy statistics for each model. These are further discussed in the evaluation section below. It is however evident that the best performing model, in terms of mean accuracy, is Direction-BiLSTM. The architecture of this model is depicted in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5 Chosen BiLSTM model Full size image Table 3 Bin ranges for each class Full size table Fig. 6 Magnitude-CNN model Full size image Fig. 7 Flowchart for voting classifier Full size image Daily price change magnitude prediction Another prediction model tries to predict the magnitude of the change of closing day prices as a multi-class classification problem. This is done by predicting which interval the closing day price changes would fall into. Closing day prices were categorised into ten different bins/classes. An average of the maximum positive ($1563) and maximum negative price ($1746) changes was calculated (and rounded to $1650) to define the lower and upper bins/classes (that were extended to included any greater price change), and then equal steps (of $330) calculated for each bin in between, as can be seen in Table 3 . As before, to predict the magnitude of change in price on the following day, three models were implemented using an LSTM, CNN and BiLSTM, which we’ll refer to as Magnitude-LSTM, Magnitude-CNN and Magnitude-BiLSTM for the remainder of this paper. Table 4 summarises the hyperparameters and training settings used for these models, together with the evaluation results (see the evaluation section for this discussion). The Magnitude-CNN model outperforms the other two for this task, as is evident from the mean accuracy and F1 scores. Figure 6 depicts the architecture of this model. Table 4 Hyperparameters for the best models for predicting magnitude of change Acc. F1 Score - The sum of the individual F1 Scores of each label/class Full size table Voting classifier The best performing models from each of the aforementioned predictive tasks, more specifically, the Direction-BiLSTM and Magnitude-CNN models, were merged together to create a voting classifier model which takes into consideration the outputs from the two models. As Fig. 7 shows, the voting classifier works by first predicting the next day’s closing price direction and then, the magnitude of the next day’s closing price using the second model. Then, it checks whether the next day’s closing price direction matches the direction of the predicted change magnitude. In other words, a match happens: (i) if the first model outputs a 0, which means a decrease in price, and the second model outputs a class from 1 to 5 (negative magnitude of price change); or (ii) if the first model outputs a 1, which means an increase in price, and the second model outputs a class from 6 to 10 (positive magnitude of price change). The prediction of the next day’s closing price direction is kept if there is a match in the output of the two classifiers. Moreover, the voting classifier is evaluated on 50 different runs with 50 differently shuffled datasets. Evaluation Fig. 8 Mean accuracy Full size image Fig. 9 Maximum accuracy Full size image Fig. 10 Difference between maximum and lowest accuracy (DBMLA) Full size image Tweet analysis The tweets in the dataset are analysed to see how many of the tweets are positive, negative or neutral according to the sentiment scores assigned by VADER. As can be seen, there are more positive and neutral tweets than negative ones. Moreover, the same query was made on the daily grouped data. This resulted in all days being either positive or neutral on average with no days being negative at all. When analysing this metric and the graphs in Fig. 11 , one can come to the conclusion that the dataset is imbalanced. However, this dataset contains all tweets with ‘#btc’ and ‘#bitcoin’ and therefore, the dataset reflects the reality of tweets. In addition, it could very well be the case that people tend to tweet more positively than negatively as seen in Pantano et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ), Zhou et\\xa0al. ( 2013 ), Abraham et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ) and Kraaijeveld and De Smedt ( 2020 ). Fig. 11 Tweet sentiment\\xa0polarity analysis Full size image Daily price trend prediction For the three price direction prediction models (Direction-LSTM, Direction-CNN and Direction-BiLSTM) at different time-lags of 1, 3 and 7 days, Figs. 8 , 9 and 10 display the mean accuracy, the maximum accuracy and the range—the difference between maximum and minimum accuracies, or Difference between Maximum and Lowest Accuracies (DBMLA) respectively. See Table 2 for descriptive statistics corresponding to these plots (Fig. 11 ). The mean and maximum are computed over 5 runs for each model, with data randomly shuffled for each run. These results give rise to the following observations. First, mean accuracy is highest for a single day lag, with the 7-day lag in second place. Despite the highest mean accuracy being obtained in the shortest time lag, we cannot definitively conclude that the price fluctuation is strongest over shorter time periods since we also observe that a 7-day lag achieves a higher mean accuracy than a 3-day lag. At the same time, the relationship is not linear. Whilst a 3-day lag results in the lowest accuracies on average, when considering the maximum accuracy obtained by a model, higher maximum scores are observed for a 3-day lag (with the exception of the CNN model). This implies that the results suggest that mean accuracies are subject to considerable variation, leading to an effect whereby short time lags of 1 day may benefit from an ‘immediacy effect’ (fluctuations which are closer in time can be better predicted on average). While longer time lags may result in lower variance in the data overall (so that averages over 7-day lags are better than those over 3 days). Fig. 12 Prediction accuracy: Comparison of LSTM, CNN and BiLSTM models Full size image Figure 12 shows a direct comparison of the best CNN, BiLSTM and LSTM models. The BiLSTM architecture (Fig. 5 ) achieves overall higher mean accuracies coupled with lower variance, as evidenced by its lower DBMLA. Hence, it is considered the best model overall. It is worth noting that this model achieves a maximum accuracy that outperforms those reported in Galeshchuk et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ), Li and Dai ( 2020 ) and Livieris et\\xa0al. ( 2021 ). The main reason for why LSTMs seem well-suited for this specific problem is that they are inherently sequential models and thus, expected to do reasonably well at predicting a trend over time. Furthermore, we can also see that if we introduce bidirectionality and allow the model to look both forwards and backwards around a given time, we can also achieve better results. The daily price trend prediction algorithm in this study results in a 64.2% maximum accuracy which is less than that of the models proposed by Pant ( 2018 ) and Valencia et\\xa0al. ( 2019 ) which resulted in 77.6% and 72% respectively. This is likely due to the data periods used. Our study spans across around 450 days, whilst their studies were based on around 180 and 60 days respectively—and looking more closely at the the data for the given periods Footnote 13 it is clear that the periods used in their studies were times of rather low volatility (by looking at the standard deviation of daily returns Footnote 14 ). Whilst in our study (which makes use of a substantially larger window) volatility is seen to fluctuate much more over the whole period. Daily price change magnitude prediction Fig. 13 F1 scores of different models on price change magnitude prediction across time lags Full size image Figure 13 displays F1 scores for the three types of models (Magnitude-LSTM, Magnitude-CNN and Magnitude-BiLSTM) for price change magnitude prediction. The corresponding descriptive statistics can be found in Table 4 . Once again, performance is generally worse with a 7-day lag in nearly all cases, whereas the shorter time lag of 1 day results in the best F1 scores. However, the CNN model outperforms the other models on the 3-day lag dataset. This is confirmed by the per-class F1 scores in Fig. 14 , where the CNN model outperforms both the LSTM and BiLSTM models in nearly all classes apart from class 4, in which the difference is in any case small. Fig. 14 F1 scores per class for the chosen Magnitude-LSTM, Magnitude-CNN and Magnitude-BiLSTM models Full size image While sequence information was found to be useful when predicting the direction of the change, here we can see that sequence information is less important when predicting the actual size of the change. Based on these results, the CNN model can be identified as the best model to predict the magnitude in price change. However, it is worth noting that F1 scores could not be reliably computed for all classes. This is likely due to data sparseness, with few instances of a given class in the test set. Voting classifier Table 5 shows that when evaluating the voting classifier, the mean accuracy was increased by around 8%, achieving a 68.4% accuracy while the maximum accuracy achieved increased by 13%, achieving a maximum accuracy of 77.2%. This significant increase in accuracy might suggest that implementing a modular approach which first identifies the direction and then predicts the actual bin for the price change, achieves higher accuracy levels. Table 5 Accuracies of Direction-BiLSTM, Magnitude-CNN and Voting Classifier Full size table Conclusions This paper compared the performance of a number of different neural models for predicting fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices from Twitter tweet data. The underlying hypothesis of this work is that opinions expressed in social media can function as useful predictors of such fluctuations, especially insofar as they incorporate features such as sentiment and opinion. One important question is whether the predictive value of features gleaned from social media depends on the time lag between their publication and the time of prediction. The experiments presented in this paper show that competitive results can be achieved with a 2-layer BiLSTM model trained on a dataset with a 1-day time lag and using seven different lagged features, meaning that each instance consists of features from tweets from the seven previous days. This model achieves a maximum accuracy of 64.18%. It must be highlighted, that whilst this configuration heeded the best results, this does not necessarily imply that a 1-day lag always results in better predictions. In fact, from the results presented herein, other temporal lags perform better under other configurations. Therefore, future work should be undertaken to further investigate the impact of temporal lags in more detail. Furthermore, whilst the BiLSTM overall outperformed the CNN and LSTM implementations for price direction prediction, the CNN outperformed the others for the change in magnitude prediction. Future work should be undertaken to further analyse with varying datasets to determine whether this is due to particular features in the data and/or why the different algorithms perform better/worse for varying parameters. As can be seen in Table 6 , the Direction-BiLSTM model presented here, which predicts the direction of the next day’s closing price, outperforms some previously proposed models, including those reported by Li and Dai ( 2020 ), McNally et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ) and Livieris et\\xa0al. ( 2021 ). In addition, the voting classifier also managed to outperform an additional two studies, Galeshchuk et\\xa0al. ( 2018 ) and Valencia et\\xa0al. ( 2019 ). On the other hand, better results have been reported on a similar task in Pant ( 2018 ), Stenqvist and Lönnö ( 2017 ) and Kilimci ( 2020 ). However, while these studies were based on data made up of 180, 30 and 90 days respectively, in this work we sought to train and generalise over a dataset of around 1 year and 3 months’ worth of data. Therefore, one would need to reevaluate the accuracy obtained for these studies on larger datasets. Table 6 Comparison with other studies Full size table A somewhat different classification task was also proposed, namely, one where rather than predicting the direction of a price fluctuation, the goal is to determine the magnitude of the next day’s closing price. The performance of this task cannot be compared to other studies’ because this is the first study that tries to predict the size of the next day’s closing price change. Here, it was shown that a model based on a 2-layer CNN with a 2-day time lag and 3 lagged features performs reasonably well, with a 57% accuracy over 10 classes. In addition, this model manages to achieve a direction accuracy of 63.3%, which is calculated by checking the predicted class, where classes 1-5 indicate a downtrend prediction while classes 6-10 indicate an uptrend prediction. With regards to how lag affects price, it was evident that in nearly all cases the dataset with 7 days lag performed worst, suggesting that a 7-day lag is too long to capture a predictive relationship between social media content and price. In general, a 3-day lag results in higher maximum accuracies, though at the expense of lower overall means and a higher variation (as reflected in the DBMLA, the difference between minimum and maximum accuracy). Thus, a 1-day lag might yield more reliable predictions, since tweets are closer to the affected price. On the other hand, a slightly longer time period of 3 days might allow for possible ‘ripple effects’, whereby sentiment and opinion accumulate over time in response to ongoing trends, yielding good predictions for future trends in some cases. The precise nature of the relationship between time and predictive power of sentiment in economic matters is an important avenue for future work. The main obstacle singled out in relation to achieving better accuracy results is the data used to train and test the implemented model because since the data is grouped daily, it causes the dataset to shrink to only a record per day, making the dataset small and hence, more difficult for the models to generalise over. Therefore, collecting more tweets and building a bigger dataset could prove vital in following up on this research. Furthermore, the models presented here could also be tested on several time windows with varying lengths to see whether they perform better in specific ranges of time. Moreover, when it comes to the prediction of the magnitude of price change, changing the number of classes to be predicted might also result in better accuracy results. Finally, investigating a similar approach using hourly grouped data and carrying out sentiment analysis by using tweets’ raw text as input to an embedding layer are other areas which can explored in order for this study to be advanced and furthered upon. Whilst this paper focuses on sentiment analysis for Bitcoin price prediction, many different investment and trading strategies exist, and it would be opportune to investigate in future how this and other sentiment based strategies compare with other investment and trading strategies. Given that public sentiment can provide an indication towards Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) price change, it would be beneficial to investigate how: (i) investor attention and sentiment dispersion (investigated by Suardi et\\xa0al. ( 2022 )) may be used to augment the work presented herein; and (ii) how to predict change in public sentiment—a recent study demonstrates the effect that popular figures (in this case Elon Musk) may have on public sentiment (Zaman et\\xa0al. 2022 ).

The last time BTC dominance tested this level was on July 13 when the market started craving new capital inflows. Meanwhile, data shows almost 95% of Bitcoin supply remains stationary in the past month, marking a new all-time high. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance continues to stand, recording multimonth highs. Meanwhile, investors have chosen to leave their BTC holdings be, neither succumbing to selling appetite nor cashing in for quick gains. Also Read: Bitcoin price faces rejection at $28,485 hurdle and looks ready to slide lower. Open Interest, funding rate FAQs How does Open Interest affect cryptocurrency prices? Higher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. How does Funding rate affect cryptocurrency prices? Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency’s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur. Bitcoin dominance rises despite stationary BTC Bitcoin dominance is rising, recording up to 51.25% as of the time of this writing, as indicated in the chart below from TradingView. The rise has been steady, particularly in October, with a sustained record of higher highs and higher lows. Notably, the last time BTC dominance was this high was around July 13, around the time when analysts were calling for more capital inflows . This makes the current reading more of a watershed momentum for BTC holders as it is a three-month high. Based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), momentum remains strong – if overbought – with the histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) also bolstering this stance. A move back down out of the overbought zone on RSI, however, could signal another pullback. BTC dominance Skew, a renowned trader, has attributed the newly found gusto for Bitcoin to increased market de-risking into the $27,400 to $27,300 zone. $BTC CVDs & Delta Overall there's been a lot of market de-risking into $27.4K - $27.3K important area now because losing that level would take prices back to 1W demand more importantly, around here into tomorrow buyers need to establish price control for a move higher pic.twitter.com/t2Ijtsep2t — Skew Δ (@52kskew) October 9, 2023 Meanwhile, recent data shows that almost 85% of Bitcoin supply remains stationary over the last month. This is a new all-time high and points to holders playing the long game as opposed to giving in to their risk appetites. JUST IN: 94.8% of the #Bitcoin supply has not moved in the past month, a NEW ALL TIME HIGH pic.twitter.com/bNa4MdFbKW — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 10, 2023 It also indicates that BTC has a strong community who are realizing the value of BTC for the future – that is, confidence in its long-term potential for realizing its value. With investors holding tight, Bitcoin price has a chance to recover and is likely to overpower the selling pressure. Investors could be flocking to the world's largest cryptocurrency during times of uncertainty and moving away from riskier altcoins. Using Bitcoin as a safe haven much like Gold.

Sentiment on the \"Fear and Greed Index\" shows it is at its lowest levels in a year. Negative sentiment has\\xa0encompassed the crypto markets as Bitcoin\\'s social sentiment shifted to a full-on bearish outlook. Bitcoin\\'s 30-day MVRV ratio shows that short-term BTC traders are down by more than 10% on their initial investment. Bitcoin price dropped to lows in the $47,000 zone after recording its all-time high at almost $65,000 in the previous week. Bitcoin sell-off similar to March 2020 After panic sparked by the rumor that US President Joe Biden would be announcing a bill to increase capital gains taxes for those generating an annual income of more than $1 million, the crypto markets crashed in tandem with the stock market. While Bitcoin has recovered slightly since the deep plunge below $50,000, the market sentiment has shifted over the last week of price action. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures\\xa0current sentiments across the crypto market, moved from “Extreme Greed” toward\\xa0“ Fear ,” as most cryptocurrencies traded in a sea of red. The Index measures aspects of the market, including its volatility , trading volumes, momentum, social media sentiments\\xa0and trends. The current levels of fear around 27 points have not been seen since a year ago when\\xa0Bitcoin price action was affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic crisis. The low level shown by the metric indicates that investors are as worried about losing capital with Bitcoin as they were a year ago. Crypto fear and greed index Further, Bitcoin’s Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) on-chain metric suggests that coins moving on the blockchain are on average doing so at a loss, just ten days after Bitcoin set a record high. This dip argues that there has been a wave of panic sell-offs by short-term traders. Bitcoin network realized profit/loss Bitcoin’s social sentiment has also dropped to a negative value as the community continues to panic over the short-term potential price action of the leading cryptocurrency. Following Bitcoin’s \"peak hype,\"\\xa0a period of consolidation and correction has started. According to behavioral analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin’s social metrics point out that investors are no longer expecting new highs and a perennial bull market in the near future. The market has shifted to a bearish outlook , which indicates the anticipation of further losses and deeper corrections. Bitcoin social sentiment Additionally, Bitcoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio that tracks the average profits and losses of all BTC addresses tells the story of short-term traders trading down by around 11.7% on their initial investment. Bitcoin MVRV The RSI metric, which calculates the balance between buyers and sellers, is almost at the lows of March 2020, indicating that Bitcoin is oversold. Bitcoin RSI Extreme bearish sentiment and oversold indicators could be pointing to short-term price bottoms, which could alleviate further selling pressure.

This decline points to the bears taking over the market, but investor sentiment has not swung the way it normally would in such circumstances. Instead of swinging toward bearish momentum, investors are rather leaning toward greed, suggesting that they do not expect this decline to last. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Moves Toward Greed The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index measures investor sentiment toward the market by taking into account things like surveys, social media posts, market volume, and volatility, among others. The aggregate of these metrics is then used to determine if investors are feeling bearish or bullish.

The 48-53 level represents neutral sentiment, which is where the index has been for the last week. The direction in which the index points toward neutral is of interest here. On Monday, the index was sitting at a completely neutral score of 50. However, by Tuesday, the index is now sitting at a neutral score of 53. This move from 50 to 53 indicates that despite the price of BTC falling below $29,000, investors are still viewing it in a positive light. Otherwise, the index would’ve fallen below 50. Fear & Greed Index sitting at 53 | Source: alternative.me Given this, the chances that the current decline will not last long are high. This is because investors being bullish about BTC means they’re likely to put more money into it. Once such buying pressure begins to mount, then BTC could recover above $29,000 once more. Attention Remains On BTC On Monday, Bitcoinist reported an 82% spike in Bitcoin’s daily trading volume, indicating renewed interest in the digital asset. This saw BTC’s trading volume climb to $10.8 billion, but the cryptocurrency has still not slowed down. BTC’s daily trading volume also saw another significant jump on Tuesday , rising 22% in the 24-hour period. This brought the digital asset’s daily volume to $13.4 billion at the time of writing. This continuous rise reiterates the rising interest in the asset, showing that the move in the Fear & Greed Index toward the greed territory is not a fluke.

And if this is the case, then BTC will likely recover over $29,000. A recovery above this mark would put the digital asset back on track to retest the $30,000 resistance before the weekend.

       "  'text': \"Introducing Gemini's BitcoinBuzz Sentiment Indicator | Gemini Log in | Create a Gemini account Sign in Create a Gemini account Blog home PRODUCT JUN 14, 2023 Introducing Gemini's BitcoinBuzz Sentiment Indicator GEMINI ANALYTICS TEAM At Gemini, we provide our users with tools to explore the crypto world, whether they want to trade, store, and stake crypto, or simply learn more about our expansive industry. Today, we are thrilled to unveil the BitcoinBuzz Indicator, a tool to empower crypto enthusiasts and traders with dynamic insights into the world of Bitcoin and crypto. Every Friday, the BitcoinBuzz Indicator* will be included in our Weekly Market Updates. In each Weekly Market Update, we will display an updated BitcoinBuzz dial and its components (more on them below), showing how each has changed over the past week. What is the BitcoinBuzz Indicator? Understanding the Buzz BitcoinBuzz Indicator Components Analyzing and Combining the Components How Has BitcoinBuzz Fared Historically? What is the BitcoinBuzz Indicator? BitcoinBuzz is a cutting-edge BTC indicator that offers a comprehensive view of price movements. By harnessing in-depth sentiment analysis, BitcoinBuzz combines news sentiment, on-chain BTC flows, Gemini BTC volumes, BTCUSD price momentum, and BTCUSD breadth. Together, these components paint a picture of BTC sentiment swings, with a user-friendly score between 1 and 10. While certainly not forward looking, the BitcoinBuzz Indicator offers a clear and concise snapshot of sentiment trends, helping you better understand the rapidly evolving BTC market. Understanding the Buzz We’ve divided the BitcoinBuzz scale into 5 categories, ranging from Buzzing Frenzy, reflecting the relative highest potential buzz around Bitcoin, to Buzzing Lull, implying a quiet period for Bitcoin. BitcoinBuzz Scale Buzzing Frenzy: (8.5-10): There is an extremely high level of buzz and excitement surrounding Bitcoin. This represents a state of intense market activity, widespread interest, and a surge of positive sentiment. It suggests a market in a state of euphoria. Buzzing Chatter (6-8.5): There is a high level of discussion, attention, and positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, suggesting an active and engaged market, with increased awareness and interest among investors. This indicates a market that is abuzz with positive discussions and anticipation. Buzzing Shift (4-6): This reflects a transitional phase in market sentiment and buzz surrounding Bitcoin. It suggests a shift or change in the prevailing sentiment, indicating a potential turning point in market dynamics. This category acknowledges the fluid nature of market sentiment and the possibility of a shift in market conditions. Buzzing Whispers (2.5-4): This represents a relatively quiet and subdued market environment and discussion around Bitcoin. It suggests a lack of significant attention or enthusiasm, potentially indicating a period of consolidation or decreased interest from market participants. Buzzing Lull (1-2.5): This denotes an extremely low level of buzz and interest surrounding Bitcoin. It represents a state of minimal activity, diminished discussion, and negative sentiment. It may indicate a market slump, lack of confidence, or a significant decline in interest and engagement. BitcoinBuzz Indicator Components The Indicator score, between 1-10, incorporates various data points, including: Crypto news sentiment Onchain BTC flows Gemini BTC volumes BTCUSD price momentum BTCUSD breadth At its core, BitcoinBuzz is a composite indicator that analyzes the variables above to arrive at a single score. A reading above 7 or below 3 suggests extreme market conditions, with higher numbers indicating positive sentiment and lower numbers indicating negative sentiment, as outlined above. Analyzing and Combining the BitcoinBuzz Components To distill the content data we collect, we use advanced techniques to extract sentiment from crypto news and combine that with BTC price and on-chain data. Crypto News Our crypto news sentiment indicator uses word embeddings to determine whether news on BTC is positive or negative. Word embeddings are numerical representations of words that capture their semantic relationships, enabling machines to understand and process language more effectively. BTC Price and Flows Onchain BTC flows provide insights into the activities of BTC whale wallets that interact with the Gemini Exchange. Gemini BTC volumes represent an overall view of Gemini Exchange volumes that can reflect overall buying and selling pressure in the market. BTCUSD momentum helps identify BTC price movements by considering various moving average pairs and short- and long-term volatility. This element combines these moving averages and volatility parameters to arrive at a single risk-adjusted reading of BTCUSD momentum. BTCUSD breadth measures the strength of BTC's price relative to its 52-week high and low, as well as its distance from the upper and lower Bollinger Bands . By tracking the relative strength of BTC, a general trend develops to enhance the descriptive nature of the BitcoinBuzz Indicator. Putting it All Together These components are subsequently smoothed out using a 30-day exponential moving average to reduce noise and whipsaws. The ultimate BitcoinBuzz Indicator between 1 and 10 is defined by the sum of mean-weighted results of all these components, and is further smoothed using a five-day exponential moving average to account for volatility differences between the components. How Has BitcoinBuzz Fared Historically? The chart below shows the price of bitcoin in orange overlaid on the BitcoinBuzz Indicator score. Keep an eye out for the BitcoinBuzz Indicator in our Weekly Market Updates, to help you gauge the overall sentiment and momentum of the BTC market over the past week. Onward and Upward!

Discover SCENE Bitcoin posted impressive gains of over 6% in the past 24 hours, reaching a high of $26,350 on Friday morning, per data from CoinGecko . Bitcoin’s price surge came alongside a wider uplift in the cryptocurrency market, which saw the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies rise over 4% in the past day, to $1.17 trillion. It follows a rise in U.S. and Asian stock markets after major lenders in J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and others agreed to inject $30 billion to save U.S.-based First Republic Bank from insolvency, promoting risk-on sentiments. AD AD Earlier this week, U.S. inflation data for February came along the lines of market expectations, showing signs of slowing down. The CME FedWatch tool shows that traders have put an 84.1% chance that the Fed will raise rates by 25 bps, while the rest predict that Fed could also maintain the current rate. The dollar\\'s yield is declining as the Fed potentially moves away from quantitative tightening, prompting renewed interest in risk-on assets like stocks and crypto from investors. Entering a regime of “QE light” On Thursday, the European Central Bank also raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 base points (bps), putting further pressure on DXY with a relatively higher-yielding euro than the dollar. \"Bitcoin is reacting to the increase in the Fed\\'s balance sheet and the form of \"quantitative easing (QE) light\" taken in response to Silicon Valley Bank,\" Nathan Batchelor, managing partner at Biyond Trader, told Decrypt . He added that, \"Technically Bitcoin is wildly bullish above $25,000 and looks to be targeting $28,000 at a minimum.\" Another factor influencing Bitcoin\\'s price is the risk of a global banking crisis . Banks worldwide in Europe and the U.S. are facing a potential insolvency crisis. While the state governments and other larger institutions like J.P. Morgan have backstopped the fallout for now, uncertainty around a banking failure is helping to build positive sentiment around decentralized alternatives such as Bitcoin.

The Network Value to Transactions or NVT ratio is somewhat comparable to a P/E ratio, in that it compares the number of transactions of a particular coin on a set day against that coin\\'s market cap. A low NVT ratio means that that transaction volume of a cryptocurrency is growing faster than the coin\\'s market cap - meaning investor sentiment is bullish, or optimistic - whereas a high ratio refers to a network that has a relatively high network value but low network activity - meaning sentiment is bearish, or negative.

       " {'title': 'Bitcoin (BTC) sentiments shift to long-term holders',\n",
       "  'text': 'Bitcoin (BTC) sentiments shift to long-term holders Bitcoin’s volatility has increased to 340%. While this dates back to October 2, 2023, it shows that the month will be better for BTC. The effect is such that the price is trading positively at $27,664.40, an increase of 0.25% in the last 24 hours. Most importantly, Bitcoin seems to have changed its priorities and tracks from serving short-term holders to long-term holders. This is evident from the number of supplies. The number of short-term holders stands at less than 1 million BTC. On the other hand, it is more than 1 million BTC for long-term holders. As of now, there is no clear sign about how or why the change is happening, but it is safe to assume that Bitcoin was always meant to serve long-term holders. Initially pitched as an alternative to gold investment, it only makes sense for holders to stay in the game for as long as possible. If technical complexities have to be eliminated, then it can be said that the token was rallying so low that holders preferred to either expand their portfolio with more purchases or retain their holdings to sell later. Technically, staying long-term is expected to help holders. BTC price prediction estimates that the token can still end the year with a value that is closer to an all-time high mark—that is, $65,000. That is a long shot since the token can also beat the bush at around $27,000. Buying tokens does come out as a sensible option, for the future predictions are optimistic. Traders may still want to hesitate, as the crypto market has not completely shed the volatility factor. The recent episode of SEC vs. XRP may have provided this stimulus to BTC. According to reports, the judge denied the SEC’s motion to appeal the ruling that XRP was not marketed as a security to retail consumers. That has set the tone for the entire crypto industry. The SEC continues to look for more ways to encircle the crypto industry to protect customers’ interests and bring transparency. What happens next remains to be seen as Gary Gensler avoids questions about cases that are under scrutiny. One incident that could still go against Bitcoin and others is the rise of cybercrime crime. Many scammers are targeting crypto holders and the native network to drain funds. Stars Arena was the most recent victim of a breach worth $3 million in AVAX tokens. The network has said that it has been able to revive a major portion of the supply, enough to cover the losses. But such security breach incidents don’t really advocate well for the crypto market. Bitcoin has been able to tackle hitting its lowest value in 2023. It will not come as a surprise if it tackles security-related issues, too.

What will the price of Bitcoin be next month? According to our Bitcoin forecast, the price of Bitcoin will increase by 9.24% over the next month and reach $â\\x80¯29,792 by November 10, 2023. What is Bitcoin's 50-Day SMA and what does it indicate? Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s 50-day SMA (simple moving average) is currently $â\\x80¯26,576. The 50-day SMA indicates the average price of Bitcoin over a 50-day period. The 50-day SMA is commonly used to gauge the price trend of an asset over an intermediate period of time. A rising 50-day SMA indicates a positive BTC price trend in the medium term, while a dropping SMA indicates the opposite. The 50-day SMA is calculated by adding together Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s closing prices in the last 50 days, and dividing the total by 50. What is Bitcoin's 200-Day SMA and what does it indicate? Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s 200-day is currently $â\\x80¯28,032. The 200-day SMA is a popular indicator thatâ\\x80\\x99s used to determine an assetâ\\x80\\x99s long-term price trend. A rising Bitcoin 200-day SMA indicates a positive long-term trend. Meanwhile, a falling 200-day SMA shows that BTC has been trending downwards over the long term. Many cryptocurrency traders pay close attention to the markets when the current Bitcoin price crosses an important moving average like the 200-day SMA. The 200-day SMA is calculated by taking Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s closing prices in the last 200 days, adding them together, and dividing the total by 200. What is Bitcoin's 14-day RSI and what does it indicate? Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s 14-day RSI is at 54.96, indicating that BTC is currently neutral. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a very popular technical indicator used to analyze prices of a variety of assets, including Bitcoin. Most commonly, the RSI is used on a 14-day time frame. The RSI is used to gauge momentum in the market. The readings produced by the RSI indicator range from 0 to 100, with 30 and 70 being important levels. An RSI reading under 30 indicates that the asset is currently undervalued, while an RSI reading above 70 indicates that the asset is currently overvalued. Will Bitcoin go back up? Based on our algorithmically generated price prediction for Bitcoin, the price of BTC is expected to decrease by 9.24% in the next month and reach $â\\x80¯29,792 on Nov 10, 2023. Additionally, Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s price is forecasted to gain 122.77% in the next six months and reach $â\\x80¯60,755 on Apr 6, 2024. Finally, Bitcoin is expected to trade at $â\\x80¯113,237 on Oct 8, 2024, following a 315.20% value decrease in one year. How does our price prediction for Bitcoin work? The Bitcoin price prediction on CoinCodex is calculated using the historical Bitcoin price dataset, accounting for past volatility and market movements. In addition, the algorithm uses the cyclical nature of Bitcoin halvings , which introduce extra supply-side pressure on BTC every 4 years. This has historically played a pivotal role in cryptocurrency markets and is a major component of creating a realistic Bitcoin prediction.

Expert Weighs In. a month ago | coincodex.com Load More How to read and predict Bitcoin price movements? Bitcoin traders use a variety of tools to try and determine the direction in which the BTC market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to predict the Bitcoin price, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Bitcoin Price Prediction Indicators Moving averages are among the most popular Bitcoin price prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for BTC over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for BTC is a sum of BTCâ\\x80\\x99s closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the crypto market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the BTC price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Bitcoin. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually a sign of weakness in the BTC market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the BTC price. How to read Bitcoin charts and predict price movements? Most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Bitcoin with different granularity â\\x80\\x93 for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Letâ\\x80\\x99s use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into â\\x80\\x9ccandlesâ\\x80\\x9d that give us information about Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display BTCâ\\x80\\x99s opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that Bitcoin reached within the 1-hour period. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also important to pay attention to the color of the candle â\\x80\\x93 a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. What affects the price of Bitcoin? Just like with any other asset, the price action of Bitcoin is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental events such as block reward halvings , hard forks or new protocol updates. Regulations, adoption by companies and governments, cryptocurrency exchange hacks, and other real-world events can also affect the price of BTC. The market capitalization of Bitcoin can change significantly in a short period of time. When trying to make a Bitcoin forecast, many traders also try to monitor the activity of BTC â\\x80\\x9cwhalesâ\\x80\\x9d, which are entities and individuals that control large amounts of BTC. Since the Bitcoin market is relatively small compared to traditional markets, â\\x80\\x9cwhalesâ\\x80\\x9d can single-handedly have a big influence on Bitcoinâ\\x80\\x99s price movements. Bullish and bearish price prediction patterns Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making cryptocurrency price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish. Here are some of the most commonly followed bullish candlestick patterns: Here are some common bearish candlestick patterns: Hammer Bullish Engulfing Piercing Line Morning Star Three White Soldiers Bearish Harami Dark Cloud Cover Evening Star Shooting Star Hanging Man DISCLAIMER: Not Investment Advice The information provided is for general information purposes only.

       "  'text': 'Ether-Bitcoin (BTC) Ratio Drops to 15-Month Low as ETH ETFs Disappoint share on Facebook share on LinkedIn share on Twitter Investors continue to prefer ether over bitcoin in a high interest rate environment. Top two ether futures ETFs listed last week register dismal volumes, per Kaiko. The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio continues to lose ground amid the lack of meaningful demand for the recently launched futures-based ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETH/BTC fell to 0.05675 late Monday, reaching the lowest since July 2022, according to charting platform TradingView. The ratio has declined by nearly 30% since Ethereum implemented Merge in mid-September last year. As many as six ether futures ETFs went live in the U.S. last week, opening doors for traders looking to take exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency without owning it. The early response has been tepid, with the big two - VanECK\\'s EFUT and ProShares EETH - registering an average daily trading volume of $5 million in the first week, according to Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko. That\\'s a far cry from ProShares Bitcoin Strategy\\'s (BITO) first-day trading volume of $1 billion. ProShares bitcoin futures ETF debuted at the height of the crypto bull run in October 2021. Since then, the crypto market has taken a beating, with higher interest rates worldwide taking the wind out of the unprecedented risk-taking seen after the coronavirus-induced crash of 2020. Per Kaiko, the bear market could be responsible for ether\\'s underperformance relative to bitcoin. \"ETH’s underperformance is likely due to the ongoing impact of the bear market, which historically has seen traders turn to BTC, the oldest and largest crypto asset. ETH spot trade volume has also stayed mostly flat over the past two months, only spiking above $2bn a handful of times,\" Kaiko\\'s research team said in a weekly note to subscribers on Monday. The increased haven demand for bitcoin is also evident from its dominance rate or the share in the total crypto market, which has increased from 41% to 51% this year. Per Amberdata\\'s Greg Magadini, ether is at a disadvantage in the higher interest rate environment compared to bitcoin. \"If ETH is the crypto tech stock and BTC is crypto gold, the higher rate environment we currently see in the macro landscape will have an outsized impact on the \\'long duration\\' tech stock. Digital gold also is hurt by higher rates, but a bid is found in response to global fiat uncertainty and geopolitical risk,\" Magadini said in an email, noting the potential for continued ether underperformance ahead. Last month, the Federal Reserve signaled that it intends to keep the benchmark borrowing cost above 5% next year, having lifted the same by 525 basis points since March 2022 to control inflation. Bitcoin is widely seen as a digital gold in the crypto market, thanks to an inbuilt code on its blockchain that reduces the pace of its supply expansion by 50% every four years. The fourth so-called halving is due next year. Magadini said the regulatory outlook also favors bitcoin. \"BTC enjoys the \\'commodity\\' asset category while ETH remains unclear. This crypto sector regulatory issue has a much higher impact on ETH,\" Magadini noted. \"Even if ETH is deemed a “commodity” the DeFi projects built on TOP of ETH are subject to regulatory scrutiny. If DeFi usage drops in response to regulation, then the EIP-1559 Ultrasound money narrative suffers due to lower usage. The terminal value of ETH is greatly affected by the future of its issuance rate flipping from net burn to net issuance,\" Magadini added.

Going to bitcoin events and using mainstream custodial bitcoin mobile wallet apps like Cash App is a great way for bitcoin beginners to get started.  (Photo by Marco Bello/Getty Images) Getty Images Knowing how to get a bitcoin wallet and earn bitcoin online doesn’t require a lot of technical skills to get started. Furthermore, not everyone who owns bitcoin has to buy it from an exchange like eToro or Coinbase. Plenty of plumbers, hair stylists, freelance writers and content creators, babysitters and real estate agents around the world earn bitcoin. Whether you're a freelancer looking to diversify your investment portfolio for free, or a Coinbase user ready for the next step on your crypto journey, earning bitcoin is a simple way to get started that doesn’t require any money. That’s why we’re launching How To Earn Bitcoin , a new email course bringing Forbes’ expert bitcoin tips and education directly to your inbox. We’ve curated a 5-part series on bitcoin wallet basics for beginners, crypto tax accounting for freelancers, networking tips and ideas, plus ways you can get started with tools you might already have, like Cash App or social media accounts. Many of the wallet tools we reference throughout this course are free to download and use—just like it’s free to sign up for this newsletter. And you’ll get the first edition in your inbox right away. We know bitcoin can seem like a complicated, technical topic. It doesn’t have to be! Bitcoin is just digital money. If you use Venmo or PayPal, you are probably ready to try bitcoin as well. And it doesn’t have to be expensive, either. The dollar price of bitcoin fluctuates, which can make it seem like stocks. But, unlike stocks, you don’t need to pay in order to get started with bitcoin. If you’re cautious about risky investments, earning bitcoin might be the best option for beginners like you. The best way to avoid fraud (and there are plenty of crypto frauds) is to use licensed companies like Cash App, then eventually switch to self-custody wallets, which we’ll explore in the series. In putting together How To Earn Bitcoin , Forbes asked industry experts some of the following questions: How Can I Earn Bitcoin Online? Earning bitcoin can be as easy as downloading a few mobile apps and letting people know that you accept bitcoin for freelance services. Let people who already pay you directly for services know that, in addition to Venmo or PayPal or whatever method you already use, you will also accept bitcoin measured by the daily market price. You’ll also want to attract new clients or followers that are already accustomed to paying in bitcoin. You can use social media networks like Reddit, X and Nostr to connect with other people that want to use bitcoin.

There are no U.S. government agencies that classify bitcoin as a security (so far). Don’t confuse bitcoin with tokens, even though they are both referred to as types of cryptocurrency. Receiving bitcoin in exchange for goods and services is regulated as income, not a security. That means you’ll need to pay income tax on the bitcoin you receive, unlike the bitcoin you buy on an exchange platform. We’ll go over how to prepare for tax season in the How To Earn Bitcoin newsletter series. How Do I Get Bitcoin For Free? The best way to get bitcoin without spending money is to spend time earning it, as income or tips from social media followers. Then you don’t need to worry about whether the price of bitcoin goes up or if bitcoin is a good investment. Spending your time to earn bitcoin means that you can wait until the market is ripe for profit before you turn that extra income into spendable dollars, if you choose. It also means that you can start building up bitcoin savings without spending your own money. If you’re not wealthy, nor attuned to market volatility so that you feel confident in buying bitcoin as an investment, the simplest way for beginners to get bitcoin for free is to earn it online.

       "  'text': 'Bitcoin Surges 81% YTD: Is The Rally For Real Or Just FOMO? (BTC-USD) | Seeking Alpha Skip to content Explore Alpha Picks Subscribe to Premium Home Analysis News Market Data Investing Groups Explore Investing Groups Portfolios Create Portfolio Find & Compare Top Stocks Top ETFs Stock Screener ETF Screener Comparisons Explore Alpha Picks Subscribe to Premium Logan Kane 23.45K Follower s Follow Summary Bitcoin is skyrocketing, now up roughly 81% YTD amidst recent bank failures and widespread speculation that the Fed will capitulate. This comes even as several prominent crypto figures now find themselves under indictment for a laundry list of alleged financial crimes. The rally is part FOMO, but there are some big drivers behind it that suggest Bitcoin\\'s fundamental value is increasing. Fundamentally, Bitcoin is tremendously valuable, but there\\'s a wide disagreement as to what its true value is. Why you should play BTC with GBTC. RichVintage/E+ via Getty Images Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is now up over 81% for the year as of my writing this after a spate of high-profile bank failures. March\\'s chaos sparked intense investor interest in alternatives to the US banking system. Bitcoin\\'s rally has mirrored a broader explosion in investor risk appetite that has sent Apple ( AAPL ) up 29% on no news, Tesla ( TSLA ) up 72%, and meme stocks like Carvana ( CVNA ), AMC Entertainment ( AMC ), and GameStop ( GME ) up anywhere from 30% to 100%. In less than 90 days, investor sentiment has swung from fear to uninhibited greed. In general, when something surges this much in a short period of time along with other speculative investments, it\\'s likely to reverse! There are plenty of warning signs that the broader risk-on rally is being driven largely by FOMO. But is there more to the story with Bitcoin than just being caught up in a speculative frenzy among investors? Of the reasons to buy Bitcoin, \"because it\\'s skyrocketing\" is probably one to avoid. However, there are some interesting developments under the surface that point towards the fundamental value of Bitcoin increasing. There are some pros and cons to Bitcoin to weigh, and there\\'s an interesting legal situation that can offer big upside to investors in the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) as well. Data by YCharts Arguments In Favor Of Bitcoin 1. Global Adoption Continues Inflation in Argentina recently topped 100% annually , Bolivia is beset by a huge dollar shortage and rumors of an impending currency devaluation, and inflation in Turkey is hovering around 50% annually. Moreover, Colombia and Brazil have both elected left-wing governments over the past year, leading many of those with accumulated wealth to head for the exits. Bitcoin is an important check on the ability of governments to redistribute wealth by printing money. The more fear of this there is around the world, the more demand you can expect for Bitcoin at any given time. Overall market data shows steady adoption for Bitcoin, with an all-time record high number of addresses now holding at least one coin . This has allowed Bitcoin to stage an impressive price recovery after being in the dumps in late 2022 during the fallout of several alleged Ponzi-style crypto schemes that failed. While many of the bets coming in on Bitcoin are related to false rumors of new money printing in the United States, Americans\\' worst economic fears have been the day-to-day reality for many third-world countries over the last 150 years. Wherever you are in the world, Bitcoin represents insurance against rampant currency debasement. Even Argentina has acquiesced to crypto as their political situation has worsened, recently allowing Bitcoin futures to trade in Buenos Aires. The small Central American country of El Salvador has led the charge with Bitcoin adoption by making it legal tender. President Nayib Bukele\\'s authoritarian style attracted his fair share of controversy along the way. However, under his watch, murders in El Salvador fell by 57% in 2022 and are now at levels comparable to the US. There, Bitcoin makes a nice complement to the US dollar, which is used as the currency in the country. 2. Bitcoin Is Insurance Against Government Default The market currently believes that the US Federal Reserve will be successful in bringing down inflation. We know this because the 10-year inflation breakeven for TIPS is about 2.3%. If inflation is subsequently higher, then you can buy TIPS and make more than you can make in US Treasuries. If inflation is lower, you\\'d make more by buying nominal Treasuries. It\\'s possible for inflation breakevens to be wrong- after all, they didn\\'t predict the inflation surge of the 2020s so far. Of course, you can buy TIPS and make more if inflation comes in higher, but Bitcoin offers a hedge against a potentially more severe outcome, that being the Fed throwing in the towel and letting inflation soar to 20% per year or more- effectively defaulting on US government debt and ending the US dollar\\'s reign as the world\\'s reserve currency. Rampant vote buying and massive budget deficits are what got countries like Argentina and Turkey in so much trouble, and if the US were to repeatedly make the same mistakes that developing countries have we would eventually get the results they\\'ve gotten. Such a scenario would be an unmitigated disaster for the US economy and I don\\'t think it will happen, but if it does, you\\'d be glad you owned some Bitcoin, as people in the US would dump savings held in dollars en masse for alternatives like crypto. For these reasons, Bitcoin carries some insurance value against huge devaluations in the dollar. For the record, after studying the situation extensively, I don\\'t think will be America\\'s future. Replacing the patchwork system of state and local sales taxes with a 20% VAT (like a national sales tax) would effectively fix government budget deficits, and could be paired with modest tax cuts in income taxes. I firmly believe that the US would rather do this than devolve into economic and political chaos, but you never know! That\\'s why Bitcoin is so attractive now, and why gold has held its appeal for thousands of years. Arguments Against Bitcoin A few arguments against buying Bitcoin here that are worth discussing. 1. Will More Crypto Misdealings Be Exposed? Of course, the crypto world has had its own share of characters that have taken advantage of the lack of regulation in the space. These don\\'t have anything to do with Bitcoin, but they\\'re part of the broader crypto world. Terra ( LUNA-USD ) co-founder Do Kwon recently was arrested in Montenegro for his role in the $40-billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna coins. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried recently got new charges by US prosecutors added for allegedly bribing Chinese government officials, in addition to the charges from the massive FTX implosion. Crypto mogul Changpeng Zhao has moved to Dubai ( UAE ) amidst mounting investigations in the US and other countries into Binance\\'s business practices. The UAE notably has no extradition treaty with the US. Bitcoin\\'s early adoption was largely among nerdy libertarians, and the project\\'s success turned thousands of them into young multimillionaires. However, it didn\\'t take long for criminals, scammers, and money launderers to follow them into the crypto world looking to make quick money or get around the law. The number of investigations still pending and questions about the solvency of large crypto projects is a shoe that is going to drop for BTC at some point. I\\'d view it as a buying opportunity because there would be forced sellers, but this isn\\'t a risk you can totally ignore. I view the odds that all of the \" bezzle \" has successfully been rooted out of the crypto ecosystem as fairly low. Rate hikes are likely to expose the rest in time. There\\'s simply no way to know how much crime is still present in crypto, and we\\'re less than a month removed from two large crypto-focused banks shutting their doors. 2. Bitcoin Pays No Interest The clearest argument against Bitcoin now is that you don\\'t earn any interest on your money. Bitcoin does have a negative real yield as the current rate of inflation is 1.8% (this comes from mining). Next year Bitcoin will undergo a halving that will bring the rate of inflation down, but the US dollar is starting to offer some interesting competition. If we assume inflation ticks down to 3% by year-end and the Fed keeps cash rates near 5%, then Bitcoin will have a similar inflation rate but no interest. Many long-term comparisons of fiat currency vs. gold conveniently omit compound interest for fiat currency. However, choosing the wrong fiat currency has ended in disaster, as investors in China and Russia found out in the 20th century. All things considered, I do consider it a drawback that Bitcoin doesn\\'t pay interest when money market funds are paying nearly 5%. Throughout the 2010s and until 2021, this drawback didn\\'t really exist. If you believe in BTC long-term, this does make it easy to be patient though, because you can have your savings in money market funds and dollar-cost average into Bitcoin over time. 3. Bitcoin Has Maniacal Shareholders This giant rally in risk assets has stemmed in large part from a belief among speculators that the Fed isn\\'t serious about getting inflation down. But historically, there\\'s nothing unusual about a 5% cash rate and a 3% inflation rate. To the extent, BTC is tied to all the other speculative assets, its fortunes in the short term are likely to rise and fall with them. Put another way, it\\'s a risk when you put your money in the same place as hordes of reckless speculators. Sometimes they\\'re right about the assets they choose, but often they distort prices with their fear, greed, and FOMO. The thing about Bitcoin is that it\\'s clear that there\\'s tremendous value in its existing, but also a wide disagreement over what this value is. Bitcoin\\'s current market cap is a bit under $600 billion, which is about 50% bigger than the value of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), but only about 1/5 of the value of Apple. What should the value be for a global system for storing, saving, and sending wealth via the internet and outside of the control of central banks? That\\'s essentially what Bitcoin is. There\\'s tremendous disagreement about what the proper value is, but I\\'d say it\\'s worth quite a bit. GBTC: A Higher-Upside Way To Buy Bitcoin As part of this wide disagreement over the true value of crypto, the market tends to be less efficient than the stock market. For example, Bitcoin futures used to trade at a large premium to the underlying coin, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust traded at a large premium as well, and now trades at a big discount. Data by YCharts The discount is currently about 35% to the value of the underlying Bitcoin, meaning you can make a 54% return if the underlying value can be realized. To calculate your return, simply take the value of the NAV divided by the price you\\'re paying. In this case, 1/0.65= 1.54, or a return of $1.54 for every dollar you put in. So how would this happen? Grayscale is currently locking horns with the Securities and Exchange Commission over converting their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. This would allow them to create and redeem shares until they\\'ve equalized the market value of the ETF with the net asset value. The SEC denied Grayscale\\'s request but has previously approved a Bitcoin futures ETF ( BITO ). Grayscale appealed the decision to federal court in DC. This has been going on for over a year, but the reporting from the appellate court is that the judges seem to be open to the idea of letting them convert. I think Grayscale will win here. Grayscale isn\\'t the most popular these days, and they\\'ve also come under immense activist pressure over the persistent discount in GBTC. One way or another, I expect the billions in sequestered value to be unlocked from this fund. There\\'s a management fee of 2% per year, but that would pay for well over a decade of the current discount. This has been a trade that\\'s been dead money for quite a while, but something will ultimately unlock this. Bottom Line The broader rally in risk assets is speculative and likely overdone. However, the fundamental case for Bitcoin is intriguing compared with other risk assets. Combined with a roughly 54% kicker if GBTC is able to convert GBTC into an ETF, I believe that the risk/reward is good for a small to moderate-sized investment in Bitcoin via GBTC. A ruling in the case is expected sometime in Q3 of this year. Editor\\'s Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Reply Like A Amos Tuck 16 Apr. 2023 Comments (7.78K) It\\'s obvious to insiders that cryptocurrencies are worthless; behind close doors, most are shocked the price hasn\\'t permanently collapsed. This collapse is inevitable - for many reasons. The super-bubble is about to implode...and the price of BTC acts as a thermometer: the higher the price, the greater the danger for anyone owning stocks and other risk assets. Prediction: Stocks won\\'t bottom until the price of BTC is < $5,000. The S&P 500 is headed to 2400, and a collapse in BTC will provide investors with an early warning sign. When you see BTC gap downward, sell stocks hand-over-fist. Reply Like (4) Xxfactor 16 Apr. 2023 Premium Comments (7.56K) @Amos Tuck Lmao will you finally be happy then? How does it feel to now watch investors profitting massively on something you hate for the 5th time now while you make nothing shorting and calling the top since the last time spx was at 2400? I hate to break it to you but the vast majority of money in the market is from retirement and managed  accounts that have to be invested say up to 85% at all times. The chance of spx 2400 at this point is virtually zero.

A confirmed break of resistance will open the way to $32k in the longer term. Trade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX Newsletter Receive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX team Subscribe to Newsletter Risk markets have been roiled in the past few days, first by the shuttering of two US banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature, and then by fears that Credit Suisse may also be wound up as its share price continues to plunge to new all-time lows. In the past, any strong risk-off move has seen Bitcoin turn lower, but not this time. The cryptocurrency space as a whole has moved higher over the last week, driven by a growing view that a failing bank system reinforces the view that a peer-to-peer digital currency is in part immune to traditional banking woes. The current market resilience can also be traced back to the FTX/Alameda meltdown in mid-November. Bitcoin hit a low of $15,487 a couple of days later, but since then BTC has pushed further ahead and despite the late-February sell-off, it is now within a few percent of making a fresh multi-month high. It seems Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency space as a whole is becoming increasingly resilient to both defi and tradfi shocks. Cryptocurrency Meltdown Pauses After FTX and Alameda Implosion Bitcoin is now pressing against a level of resistance around $25.2k that has not been broken convincingly for months. While Tuesday’s rally took BTC to an intra-day peak of just under $26.4k, it closed around $24.6k. For BTC to make fresh gains, and the path to an eventual target of $32k looks possible, it needs to close and open above this resistance to confirm the move. All three moving averages are supportive, with the 200-dma providing strong support during last week’s sell-off, while the CCI indicator shows BTC trading in overbought territory. A few more days of consolidation and then a fresh push higher may be on the cards.

This represents a decrease of -13.42% in value. Furthermore, in the past 24 hours, XLM recorded a minor drop of -0.61%. These price movements indicate a slight bearish sentiment prevailing in the crypto market, with XLM being influenced by the broader market conditions. The recent downtrend in XLM’s price suggests that bears currently have the upper hand, while the scope for bullish activity appears limited. What Could Be Responsible For The Recent Price Dip? The Stellar ecosystem has been rife with developments in recent months, with the biggest being the launch of the Spacewalk bridge that connects the blockchain to Polkadot. The bridge was meant to enable smooth transfer of the USDC stablecoin between the two blockchains fostering increased utility and potential demand within Stellar’s ecosystem. However, this has not gone to plan, as Stellar’s price has failed to match the positive advancements in its ecosystem. Instead, bearish sentiment has engulfed XLM, which has contributed to the recent downward price movement. Related Reading: XRP Next Step: Here’s Why An Upward Move Could Be Likely The bearish sentiment indicates that market participants are cautious about XLM, leading to selling pressure and a lack of significant buying interest. It is important to consider the impact of market sentiment on short-term price fluctuations, as it can create challenges for price recovery and limit the potential for bullish momentum in the near term. What’s Next For Stellar (XLM)? Although XLM is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment, the long-term prospects for the cryptocurrency remain positive. Stellar’s roadmap for 2023 focuses on enhancing network utility through strategic initiatives. This includes making innovation easy and scalable through Soroban development, scaling and decentralization endeavors, and improving developer wallet tools. Stellar aims to win over builders by accelerating the growth of widely-used assets, promoting accessibility and user-friendly apps, and leveraging smart contracts for sustainable use cases in the DeFi ecosystem.

These initiatives are designed to strengthen Stellar’s position in the market and drive future growth. While short-term price movements may be influenced by market sentiment, the long-term success of Stellar relies on the execution of its strategic initiatives and the adoption of its network utility. XLM\\xa0 24-hour chart\\xa0 Source @ Tradingview As a result, XLM’s value could potentially increase in the future, with projections indicating the possibility of reaching $0.11 by 2024. Investors and traders should closely monitor the progress of Stellar’s roadmap and evaluate market conditions when considering the future prospects of XLM. At press time, XLM was trading at $0.09691 per coin with a 1-hour price increase of 1.1%. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

The consistent stream of news , new developments, and changing perspectives make this industry hard to keep track of by yourself. For this reason, it is important to consult various different charts and analytic sources, such as the BitDegree Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Let\\'s take a deep dive into this type of informational tool, and examine some factors to keep in mind. Spread the word - share the sentiment! Embed This Chart Fear & Greed Index Daily Values See what sentiments were driving the crypto market on select dates in the past. Yesterday 11 Oct 2023 Neutral 47 2 Days Ago 10 Oct 2023 Neutral 50 3 Days Ago 09 Oct 2023 Neutral 50 4 Days Ago 08 Oct 2023 Neutral 50 📖 Why it\\'s important: The fear and greed index chart offers a generalized view of the current market sentiments, as well as those present on specific days in the past. Used together with other trading tools, the index can help you develop a better understanding of the market\\'s sentiments, as well as the general mood that currently dominates the space. Also, you may see if certain events affect the emotions of the market in any way. Learn this metric Fear & Greed Index Historical Performance Historical sentiments of the Bitcoin, Ethereum & all other cryptocurrency markets, in the context of fear and greed. What is a Fear and Greed Index? A fear and greed index is a specialized type of chart that is designed to capture the actions and emotions that are currently driving a market . This is typically displayed in the form of a half-wheel and an arrow with one side denoting whether the market seems to be motivated by fear, and another denoting whether it is motivated by greed. Both traditional, as well as crypto fear and greed indexes are very common tools for analysing the respective markets. A crypto fear and greed index is not like other charts or graphs that you typically see on an exchange. It does not measure the price of an asset , or amounts being bought or sold, but rather, it captures a live sentiment in the crypto space, measuring how people are behaving and currently feeling about the industry. If people are worried about the future of the crypto market, predicting bearish market movements , then the index will point toward fear . However, if people anticipate greater increases in price and have strong positivity regarding the market, then the index will point toward greed . If it is in the middle, then it could indicate neutral thoughts or confusion among traders. This metric might feel infantile or a little strange, but it can really help contextualize the types of behaviors being exhibited in the industry . It can also help to give an indication as to whether you, as a trader, should be worried or not. Some people use crypto fear and greed indices as a way of comparing their own beliefs against the beliefs of the trading community, and then further use it as a way of making informed decisions of their own. Remember, while they might not seem it, the financial markets are influenced by emotion , and so, the emotions of the people involved should be listened to, as they can impact the performance of an asset. There is no concrete or fully established way to utilize a crypto fear and greed index, as people integrate them into their plans in different ways . Some follow the live crypto sentiment and act as if everybody else is doing the same, whereas others try to go in the opposite direction. Warren Buffett, a trading veteran and prominent figure in the fear and greed discourse , famously said that people should \"be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful\", suggesting a type of backward reading of the index. In truth, this type of metric is highly interpretable , so there are no hard rules on how to use it. However, this does not make it any less or more important than other types of technical analysis, as they help capture the social temperature of the crypto trading landscape, and especially the Bitcoin sentiment, as the markets often follow Bitcoin\\'s movements. Origins of the Fear and Greed Index The fear and greed index chart has a complex and somewhat unclear history. The CNNMoney index was the first of its kind - it was created in 2012, and designed specifically to measure these two sentiments on the traditional markets. However, the idea of using these metrics existed long before then. The notion of fear and greed being the main drivers of the market can be dated back to the 1930s, to the highly influential British economist and philosopher John Maynard Keynes . It could be argued that Keynes is one of the most significant Western economists in recent history, second possibly to Adam Smith, the father of Economics as we know it today. Keynes presented the idea that traders and consumers make their decisions based on certain emotive factors within them, which he called animal spirits. According to Keynes, animal spirits are the spontaneous impulses that drive people to act rather than to wait and calculate the expected outcomes of their actions. Sometimes, these impulses are optimistic and hopeful, leading people to invest, consume, and take risks. Other times, these impulses are pessimistic and fearful, leading people to save, hoard, and avoid risks. In this sense, fear and greed are two opposite reactions to the same animal spirit that influences people\\'s expectations and confidence about the future . When people are confident and expect positive outcomes, they tend to be greedy and seek more profits or benefits. When people are uncertain and expect negative outcomes, they tend to be fearful and seek more security or protection. While this idea may sound mystical, it is essentially just a set of principles in behavioral psychology, dressed up in metaphors to help the concept sink in . The idea caught on over time, to the point where fear and greed became major talking points in trading spaces. In more recent times, one of the main proponents of this idea, Warren Buffett, helped to propel it to the mainstream by discussing it throughout the last two decades , helping it to gain traction, which is what likely influenced CNNMoney to turn the concept into a real tool. And in even more recent times, a crypto fear and greed index has been created, designed to capture live crypto sentiment. What is Fear? To understand how crypto fear and greed indices work, we need to define what exactly fear and greed mean. Let\\'s start with fear. This is the emotion that arises when traders worry about the future of the market . It is the concern and discomfort that they have for the current state of the market. This feeling can arise from a myriad of factors. It could be due to regulatory anxieties, bad press, or technical analysis signs that indicate poor performance. This can manifest in traders making fewer risky bets, or even in traders following the market movements of others around them, defaulting to herd mentality due to fear that they cannot trust their own deductive and analytic skills. For our Bitdegree crypto fear and greed index, whenever the number drops below 50 , we have entered a fearful market sentiment . And anything below 20 indicates extreme fear . What is Greed? Opposite to fear is greed , which is the emotive response that occurs when traders are, not only confident, but ecstatic about the market . This leads them to make risker bets, hold onto their assets for longer than usual, and act as if each day will bring greater gains and profits than the day before. For our Bitdegree crypto fear and greed index, any number above 50 will indicate some level of overall greed in the market, and anything above 80 will indicate extreme greed . How is the Whole Index Calculated? The BitDegree crypto fear and greed index is structurally similar to the CNNMoney fear and greed index, meaning it takes in very similar types of information and provides similar outputs, but with a focus on the live crypto and Bitcoin sentiment , rather than on the traditional markets. The information used will be applied in a way that allows for the most accurate and meaningful results possible. The aim of the index is to give our user base a leg up in the trading sphere and provide them with useful insights. Traditional VS Crypto Indices There are major differences between how traditional fear and greed index charts function, compared to crypto fear and greed indices. Of course, the greatest of which is that they will be looking at different markets, and so they will produce different outputs. While there is some symmetry between the crypto and traditional markets, there are some extremely important times when they diverge in significant ways . An example of this is at the start of the COVID pandemic . The traditional markets were filled with fear as highly established sectors struggled to survive, whilst the crypto markets were marked with a sense of greed which caused the rates of various digital assets to soar. Another difference between these two indices is with the traders themselves. Again, while there is a major overlap between those who trade crypto and those who trade traditional assets , there is also a wide range of people who stick to one lane . The starkest difference you will see is that the crypto markets are typically filled with retail traders who might not have a formal education in finance , as opposed to their traditional counterparts. This is important because a lack of professional education in finance or economics means that many crypto traders will not know how to read technical analysis or have the guidance or experience to know how to effectively navigate difficult situations . This can lead to a lack of consensus as to how they should act. This can then further lead to erratic results, and could mean a more volatile movement within the crypto fear and greed index chart . Traditional investors, however, will know the ins and outs of their trade, and will have some education and background to help navigate uncertain and complicated times on the trading floor. This means that they will likely act collectively with more consensus and direction . That is not to say they will all follow the same patterns, but rather that being able to read and interpret market data better will give them all informed insights that retail crypto traders might not have. Overall, this equates to different live sentiments in both crypto and traditional markets that will often diverge, and the crypto and Bitcoin fear and greed index will likely show signs of volatility more regularly than other indices. This is not a good or a bad thing, but rather, just reflective of the natures of these two separate markets and the emotions of the people who make them up.

This is extremely helpful for people who want to see how market sentiment at the moment compares to just a few weeks or months ago . The index can be downloaded as an image, or embedded into a social media channel. This is just one of many tools BitDegree offers to help find market sentiment. X Bitcoin Index When crypto traders think of fear and greed, this X index is likely to be the one that pops into their mind. While it is not the first of its kind, it is arguably the first to gain prominence in the market , which is a testament to how important social media is for the crypto space. Interestingly, it is essentially just screenshots from the Alternative.me fear and greed index, with the added perk of having X comments/replies under each image, allowing people to have discussions about changes and behavior. Cryptochart.tech Index This is a cryptocurrency index that focuses on capturing the market sentiment for large cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum , with daily updates. Its evaluation criteria are not disclosed, however. BTCtools.io Index This fear and greed crypto index uses market data relating to volume and open interest , as well as social media data from Reddit and X and search data from Bing and Google . This is a good tool for people who want a larger range of social and user-data, rather than just economic data. Alpha Data Analytics Index Unlike others on this list, this crypto fear and greed index has two indicators , one for market awareness and one for market sentiment . The sentiment indicator is essentially the same as any fear and greed index; however, the awareness meter can help to give additional info to traders, as it is a measure of media publications that have taken an interest in cryptocurrency at a certain time. Milkroad Index Milkroad\\'s index is a simple scale that gives details on what the market sentiment is like. It is visible in practically all of Milkroad\\'s news articles. Alternative.me Index While the CNNMoney fear and greed index is the first of its kind for the traditional markets, the Alternative.me index is the original crypto-specific chart . It is many people\\'s first port of call for figuring out the market sentiment. It takes a wide range of data inputs such as market volatility, market momentum, social media, BTC dominance, Google trends, and surveys, although surveys are currently paused. CoinStats Index Unlike many of the other indices in this list, the CoinStats chart allows you to see fear and greed metrics for a range of smaller altcoins , as well as behemoths such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, you can see info on Binance\\'s BNB and KuCoin\\'s KCS tokens. This is useful for people who are looking to make a big investment in a coin that is not a market leader. Look Into Bitcoin Index This is a very simple index that offers an idea of market sentiment specific to Bitcoin. It takes its data from Bitcoin volatility, momentum and volume, Bitcoin dominance, social media, and Google trends. Why Do Some Indices Yield Wildly Different Results? If all fear and greed crypto indices measure the same two ideas, then why do some of them produce different results? The simple answer is that they are all fed slightly different data, and they all weigh that data in different ways. For instance, some indices such as the CNNMoney fear and greed index chart focus exclusively on financial data. However, others like the Alternative.me crypto fear and greed index also use surveys, social media, and search engine trends. This highlights how different indices conceptualize and aim to prove fear and greed in a variety of ways . It means that traders need to either decide on which index makes the most sense to them , or they can cross-reference across a range so they can make their own decisions. Alternatives to the Fear / Greed Index A crypto fear and greed index is only one metric that can be used to measure crypto and Bitcoin sentiment. There is a range of other tools that can be used. One method is via BitDegree\\'s social signals tab, displayed on every coin and token listed on the application. These tell you what type of social media and website attention and traffic each cryptocurrency is receiving. This means that BitDegree\\'s social signals help to provide a clearer picture of what type of interest and excitement different cryptocurrencies are receiving . Paired with its crypto fear and greed index, this can be a great way of determining which coins and tokens are worth monitoring and potentially investing in. Another interesting measurement of market sentiment is to use the Bitcoin dominance percentage . This is a measure of how dominant Bitcoin is compared to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. It is calculated by dividing the market cap of Bitcoin by the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies and multiplying it by 100. It can be used as a way of seeing whether it is worth investing in Bitcoin or, instead, in altcoins. For many years, there has been anticipation of a mythological flippening , where Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin and becomes the dominant cryptocurrency in the market. You might think this would be easiest seen by monitoring ETH\\'s price and market cap, but realistically, such activity could also occur through a lowering of Bitcoin\\'s price and market cap , making the BTC dominance percentage uniquely useful at detecting this. Finding this figure is easy as it is displayed at the top of the BitDegree website. Moving to the traditional markets, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\\'s CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the VIX index , can be used as an alternative to the fear and greed index. This chart measures market expectations of near-term price changes of the S&P 500 index . The VIX Index is infamously nicknamed the \"fear index\" due to its tendency to rise when stocks fall, and lower when stocks rise. This means that a high VIX suggests a market sentiment of uncertainty. This nickname began around the late 90s and early 2000s, when the VIX index displayed record highs during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the dot-com bubble bursting , and 9/11. Since then, traders have used it as a fear measurement . However, bear in mind that it does not measure greed in any way. Future of the Fear and Greed Index The crypto fear and greed index is a relatively new tool, and so it is fair to assume that it will experience some changes to its composition and usage. For starters, the way data is calculated may alter, possibly being influenced by emerging AI analytic tools on the market . This could offer wildly different results than currently, although this is not confirmed, and it might not make too much alteration. Another change that might occur is that crypto fear and greed indices may show indicators for whether whales or institutional investors are moving the market, as opposed to retail traders. While this distinction is less meaningful in the traditional markets, the crypto markets have always had a strong reliance on and involvement from individuals who enter the market , due to the anti-corporate streak running through it. This type of a distinction could be useful as institutional investors are sure to think differently than retail traders due to their educational background, the number of funds they move, and their intentions. Such a metric could help add clarity to traders and give them much-needed insights into the way the market is functioning. In a similar vein, an indicator showing whether financial activity is happening more on decentralized exchanges or centralized changes, such as Binance and Coinbase , could be useful. While both sectors are deeply important, a higher reliance on decentralized exchanges could suggest more adoption of blockchain ecosystems , and could also be a sign of whether there will be congestion and high transaction fees. This type of knowledge could additionally be used to measure whether there is fear towards centralized companies and corporations, as well. With some established crypto institutions falling apart, this type of indicator could be good for letting traders know whether they should be working with centralized platforms or whether decentralized networks are smarter to use. Final Words Crypto fear and greed indices are extremely useful for capturing live market sentiment , making them a must-have tool for any trader. There is a range of these charts available online, including BitDegree\\'s own crypto fear and greed index . These are great to consult before engaging in any form of crypto trading, and so they should definitely be kept in mind when working with the markets. FAQ What is a crypto fear and greed index?

Experience the power of real-time market data with MetaMask Portfolio here Key Takeaways The Milk Road Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a single metascore that quantifies crypto investor market sentiment as it relates to Bitcoin (BTC). It ranges between 0 and 100. Lower levels of the index are associated with “Fear,” while higher levels are associated with “Greed.” Analysis shows that the index can be a useful tool for informing investment decisions. But “be greedy when others are fearful” is an overly simplistic interpretation of the index that could result in suboptimal results. What is a Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The price of Bitcoin (BTC) moves on news, data, and fundamentals. But it also moves on emotion and investor sentiment. The Milk Road market fear index is a single metascore that aggregates movements in crypto fundamentals (e.g., volatility, momentum) and alternative data (e.g., social media, google trends, surveys) into one single number that ranges between 0 and 100. It can be thought of as a “pulse check” for how the average crypto investor is feeling on any given day. This article unpacks how the Milk Road Crypto Fear and Greed Index is constructed, how its outputs can be understood, and how it can be used to inform investment decisions. The final section of the article provides an overview of other crypto fear and greed Indices and their methodologies. Note: The information provided in this article does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, or tax advice. Do conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. How is The Milk Road Fear & Greed Constructed? The Milk Road Fear and Greed Index is constructed by quantifying trends across 6 different fundamental and sentiment-based factors and applying different weights to them: Volatility (25%) : Volatility is the measure of how much the price of a cryptocurrency moves during a period of time. Times of high uncertainty see high market volatility, while times of relative stability see lower volatility. The fear and greed index compares volatility over a 30-day and 90-day period and considers “unusual rises in volatility as a sign of a fearful market.” Market momentum/volume (25%): Crypto markets experience different buying and selling volumes each day. Some days are relatively quiet, while other days see a frenzy of trading activity (high volume). The crypto fear and greed index treats periods of high buying volume as indicative of greedy sentiment and periods of high selling volume as indicative of fear. Social media (15%): The fear and greed index uses social media crawlers to monitor hashtags and other activity for indications of trader sentiment. The most popular websites for this sort of analysis are Twitter and Reddit . The algorithms watch posts about crypto and monitor how many interactions they receive. An unusually high interaction rate indicates greedy sentiment. Surveys (15%): Websites that poll investors are used as input to the index. They gauge investor sentiment directly on a weekly basis. Dominance (10%): The “dominance” factor measures what percentage of the total crypto market capitalization is represented by Bitcoin. The thinking is that, since Bitcoin is traditionally seen as the safest cryptocurrency, a higher Bitcoin dominance indicates market fear, while a lower Bitcoin dominance indicates market greed. Trends (10%): Analyzing Google Trends data for various queries helps to inform the fear and greed index. An increased search volume for queries with a negative connotation, such as “bitcoin price manipulation,” indicates fear, while an increase in search volume for positive connotations indicates greed.

Subscribe Understanding Our Crypto Fear & Greed Index Low levels of the Milk Road Fear and Greed Index correspond with high levels of “Fear” in the market (and, by extension, bearish sentiment). Times of “Fear” coincide with traders trying to sell BTC quickly and generally being less sensitive to low prices. This can be driven by investors “panic selling” to limit expected losses and/or “forced selling” by way of collateral liquidations of leveraged positions. High levels of the Milk Road Fear and Greed Index correspond with high levels of “Greed” (and, by extension, bullish sentiment). Times of “Greed” coincide with investors being optimistic about the future price of BTC . This could be due to a myriad of factors, including adoption milestones, positive regulatory developments, and fear of missing out (aka “FOMO”) buy pressure. Milk Road Fear and Greed Index vs. Bitcoin Price The Fear and Greed Index varies meaningfully on a daily basis. Given that its level is largely driven by factors that can be unrelated to price, that is not entirely surprising. Take a look at the chart below. The blue line represents the daily levels of the Milk Road Fear and Greed Index. The yellow line represents the daily BTC price. As can be seen in the chart above, The Milk Road Fear and Greed Index oscillates meaningfully irrespective of BTC price. On a daily basis, the index has moved an average of ~4 points per day since the index’s inception compared to Bitcoin’s average daily price fluctuation of 2.5% over the same time period. Putting a Name to Index Levels The numerical values of the index fall into five mutually exclusive rankings, which provide a framework for interpreting the index: Extreme Fear : 0 to 24 Fear : 25 to 46 Neutral : 47 to 54 Greed : 55 to 75 Extreme Greed : 76 to 100 On a historical basis, the market has been in a state of “Extreme Fear” or “Fear” far more often than it has been in a state of “Neutrality,” “Greed,” or “Extreme Greed.” Take a look at the chart below. It shows the percentage breakdown of rankings the Fear and Greed Index has registered since its inception. Since February 2018, the market has been in a state of: “Extreme Fear” or “Fear” ~62% of the time (1,172 days out of 1,900). “Neutrality” ~9% of the time (187 days out of 1,900). “Greed” or “Extreme Greed” ~29% of the time (541 days out of 1,900). For anyone who pays attention to crypto markets, that should not be surprising … at all. “Turmoil” is a word that you’ll hear a lot around crypto circles. Just think back to how crazy the market was when Terra collapsed . Or when FTX was revealed to be insolvent . Or when Three Arrows Capital was revealed to be insolvent . Or every time the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates . You get the point. The list of events that can strike fear into Bitcoin investors seems to get longer every year. And once fear sets in, it can be hard to shake off. At other times, “irrational exuberance” is a good description of market sentiment. Just think back to how bullish investors were when BTC broke through $20K for the first time in December 2020. Or when it hit a new all-time high of ~$69K in November 2021. Or when “DeFi Summer” spurned a new class of “crypto degens” in 2020. Or when the floor price of the CryptoPunks NFT collection reached ~114 ETH (~$6.2M) in October 2021. Clearly, the market is not always in a state of turmoil. Sentiment swings are commonplace in traditional financial markets. But when it comes to crypto markets, they are more pronounced and more frequent. So, the Milk Road Fear and Greed index is a valuable tool for quantifying these swings in sentiment. But how can it be used to make investment decisions? Using The Fear and Greed Index to Inform Investment Decisions The boilerplate interpretation of any fear and greed index goes something along the lines of “Be greedy when others are fearful. And be fearful when others are greedy”. This means investors should consider adding to positions (in this case, BTC) when the index is in a state of “Extreme Fear” or “Fear.” And investors should refrain from adding to positions (and, by extension, consider selling BTC) when the index is in a state of “Greed” or “Extreme Greed.” But that’s just the boilerplate interpretation. The following analysis of historical index levels and forward BTC returns provides a more nuanced look into how the index is best interpreted. The analysis spans both the short-term (i.e., one-day fluctuations) and the medium-term (i.e., one-week to one-month trends) to provide a holistic picture of how valuable (or invaluable) the index is in informing investment decisions. The Short Term Buying or selling BTC every time the Fear and Greed Index moves up or down a few points is not a suitable investment strategy for most investors. Nor is it a smart one (in our opinion). To extract value from the index over short time horizons, identifying instances where the index has swung meaningfully over a one-day span is a good starting point. This analysis classifies directional swings of 25 points or more as “meaningful.” That is enough to swing the market from a state of “Fear” into a state of “Greed” in a single day. Since inception, there have been 22 “meaningful” index swings: 11 one-day decreases of >25 points 11 one-day increases of >25 points Take a look at the chart below. It shows 7D forward returns of BTC immediately following each of these 22 meaningful swings. In other words, had you bought BTC the day that Fear and Greed swung 25 points or more, the columns below show how your investment would have performed over the next seven days. When the index has surged by 25 points or more in a single day, BTC’s average return over the next seven days has been 4.0%. When the index has collapsed by 25 points or more in a single day, BTC’s average return over the next seven days has been -2.2%. Does this mean you should buy BTC every time the index increases 25 points? Probably not. As demonstrated in the chart above, even when the index has increased meaningfully, BTC has dropped as much as 14% over the next week. And the sample size of these meaningful swings is relatively small at 22. But based on this data, one can conclude that putting on a blindfold and buying BTC when the index collapses 25 points and selling BTC when the index surges 25 points would not have been the most profitable investment strategy historically. But what about the medium term? The Medium Term For the sake of analyzing the medium term, this analysis identifies instances where the index has sat in one ranking for a sustained period of time. In this case, 7-day (7D), 14-day (14D), and 30-day (30D) consecutive rankings or “streaks” of one ranking. Take a look at the chart below. It shows the number of “streaks” which have occurred across each of these time periods and rankings. There have been far more streaks of “Extreme Fear” and “Fear” rankings compared to streaks of “Greed” or “Extreme Greed” rankings. This is not all that surprising, given that ~62% of the time, the index has been in a state of “Extreme Fear” or “Fear.” But what does this mean from an investment perspective? Take a look at the chart below. It shows Bitcoin’s average return for the 90 days immediately following a prolonged streak of 7D, 14D, and 30D for each ranking. In other words, it shows the return one would have generated had they purchased BTC immediately after realizing that a 7D, 14D, or 30D streak occurred. The data is surprising, to say the least. BTC has performed best following periods of “Extreme Greed” and “Greed.” Following 7D ranking streaks, the average 90D forward return of BTC for “Extreme Greed” and “Greed” streaks are 149% and 126%, respectively, vs. 5% for “ Extreme Fear” streaks and 108% for “Fear” streaks. The sample set of these 7D streaks is significant. There have been seventy-four 7D streaks – the majority of which have been “Extreme Fear” or “Fear” streaks. Following 14D streaks, the average 90D forward return of BTC for “Extreme Greed” streaks was 200% compared to just 9% for “Extreme Fear” streaks. The sample set of 14D streaks is much smaller than 7D streaks. There have only been twenty-seven instances of 14D streaks – the majority of which have been “Extreme Fear” or “Fear” streaks. Following 30D streaks, the average 90D forward BTC return for “Extreme Greed” streaks was 255% compared to just 2% for “Extreme Fear” streaks. The sample set of 30D streaks is very small. The only instance of a 30D “Extreme Greed” streak was recorded in December 2020, when the price of BTC increased from $19,115 to $48,472 in the 90 days following the streak. That’s a pretty big return – even for an asset as volatile as BTC. Putting It All Together Clearly, “be greedy when others are fearful” is an overly simplistic way of interpreting the Fear and Greed Index that could result in suboptimal investment decisions. Based on an analysis of index levels and BTC price, taking stock of medium-term trends in index rankings and positioning accordingly is likely the best path forward. Historically, BTC had performed better following periods when the index was in a sustained state of “Extreme Greed” or “Greed” rather than a state of “Fear” or “Extreme Fear,” – which stands in stark contrast to the boilerplate interpretation of the index. But there is no guarantee that will be the case going forward. It should also be noted that the Fear and Greed Index is a relatively new tool. It has only been around since 2018. Given how long crypto bull and bear market cycles can be, that is a relatively short history to work off of. Finally, the Fear and Greed Index should not be considered the “be all end all” of anyone’s investment strategy. It should be viewed in conjunction with other factors such as absolute BTC price levels, individual investment goals, and, of course, risk tolerance. Other Bitcoin Fear and Greed Indexes The original fear and greed index was developed for the traditional stock market by CNN Money. The same basic idea has been applied by various websites for the crypto markets.

Alpha Data Analytics Index While most indices feature only a “sentiment” gauge, Alpha Data Analytics’s fear and greed index features that as well as an “awareness” measure. The platform also combines several sentiment factors together to come up with a “momentum” measure. These unique tools can give traders an edge when using the Alpha Data Analytics index versus others. The “awareness” indicator is a measure of how much crypto is in the public eye at any given point in time. A high awareness factor means that multiple news outlets are running crypto stories and that some headline-worthy action is underway. The “momentum” indicator is calculated by “combining the strengths of the awareness and sentiment indicators” and can be interpreted as a measure of attention growth. Alpha Data Analytics index highlights: Sentiment tracking using a proprietary AI that covers “ 350 largest news outlets and social platforms in 17 languages, reading 70 news related to the crypto topic every minute” Updates every hour Awareness factor that reflects crypto’s presence in the news media at different points in time Three additional indicators to help traders make decisions: momentum, overbought, and oversold 5. CoinStats Index The CoinStats fear and greed index shows a single metascore, similar to other indices, but also features some additional indicators that are not found on other websites such as a BTC dominance indicator, a fear and greed index chart overlaid with the prices of several different crypto assets, and market cap/24h volume figures. The metascore is calculated using volatility, market momentum, social media sentiment, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. CoinStats index highlights: Features a BTC Dominance percentage score which shows how much of the crypto market cap consists of just BTC Updated every 12 hours , which is more often than many other indices, which only update once a day CoinStats website allows you to overlay the price graphs of different assets over the fear and greed index values; these assets are BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC To Sum It Up The fear and greed index measures the mood of the crypto market. Significant fear indicates turbulent markets and signals higher prices in the future, while significant greed signals coming price crashes. Want more ways to keep up with the crypto market? Check out our daily crypto newsletter (it will probably make you laugh, too.) Frequently Asked Questions Where do I find a fear and greed index for crypto? The most popular fear and greed index is from the website alternative.me and can be viewed here . A more comprehensive price index that includes more data points can be found here . How often is a fear and greed index calculated? Most fear and greed indices are calculated once or twice a day with some more advanced ones calculated every hour. What is the highest crypto fear & greed index? The highest score on the fear & greed index is 100, which represents extreme greed. (Zero is extreme fear.) However, the alternative.me fear & greed index — the most commonly used F&G measure — has never reached 100. The widely-watched index topped out at the mid-90s in June of 2019 and reached the mid-90s again several times again from late 2020 to early 2021. What is crypto fear & greed vs. price? The fear and greed index tracks Bitcoin market sentiment. Several sites, such as Look Into Bitcoin, offer an overlay of crypto fear and greed index relative to Bitcoin’s price. While not a foolproof indicator — the F&G index as measured by Look Into Bitcoin was only at 75 when Bitcoin hit its all-time high — the index shows some interesting correlations to Bitcoin price. Several short-term price lows coincided with single-digit or low double-digit numbers in the fear & greed index, with Bitcoin later bouncing off its lows. How to use a crypto fear & greed index? The crypto fear & greed index measures the market’s emotional sentiment toward Bitcoin’s price. But, by extension, the index can be useful in trading the broad crypto market because the broad market often tracks the general direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The fear & greed index ranges from zero to 100. When the index is closer to zero, this indicates extreme fear in the market. When the index is closer to 100, this indicates extreme greed in the market. Historically, the extremes of the fear & greed index have been a better indicator of market bottoms than of market tops. The highs on the index were followed by further price appreciation, in many cases, with the index cooling down before the market reached a short-term top. However, crypto prices can move for a number of reasons, so it’s probably wiser not to rely on a single indicator to decide your next trade. Does the crypto fear & greed index work? At a basic level, the fear & greed index is an indicator of fear (an index value closer to zero) or greed (an index value closer to 100). But there are several factors that go into the calculation to gauge market sentiment for Bitcoin — and the rest of the crypto market by extension. The fear & greed index weighs all of the following data points: Volatility Market momentum/volume Social media Surveys Bitcoin dominance Google Trends In effect, the F&G index takes the pulse of the market to see how we feel about Bitcoin’s price collectively. Extreme fear could mark a coming reversal – although that’s not always the case. A high fear & greed index followed by a tapering trend could indicate that the market has lost its exuberance and prices have peaked (or soon will). Again, exceptions to this pattern aren’t hard to find. Still, the F&G index can be one of many indicators traders might consider when planning their next moves.

Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Photo by Hugo Amaral/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Despite bitcoin\\'s recent price volatility, the digital currency\\'s largest stakeholders, often dubbed the \" whales \" in financial markets, are displaying optimism. Their recent accumulation activities indicate they see hope amid market uncertainty. According to recent insights from the analytics company IntoTheBlock , addresses that hold a minimum of 0.1% of all circulating bitcoin, equating to a valuation above $500 million, have amplified their assets by a staggering $1.5 billion within the concluding fortnight of August. IntoTheBlock  - Bitcoin Large Holder Netflows IntoTheBlock The surge in accumulation transpired even as inflows to centralized exchanges were almost nil. Lucas Outumuro, IntoTheBlock\\'s chief researcher, observes that this pattern suggests an \"organic buying demand\" rather than a relocation of funds to exchange-centric addresses. The activity of these \"whales\" holds significance. Given their control over large bitcoin holdings, their transaction decisions can create ripples across the cryptocurrency market. Thus, experts alike closely monitor their movements to predict potential market shifts. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best Travel Insurance Companies By Amy Danise Editor Best Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans By Amy Danise Editor The purchases coincided with the bitcoin price plummeting to its lowest point in two months, a decline momentarily offset by a pivotal legal ruling favoring Grayscale\\'s pursuit to enlist a U.S. based spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. A federal appellate court mandated the commission to re-evaluate its earlier decision against transitioning the $14 billion Grayscale Bitcoin BTC Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. Market experts see this court decision as a step toward launching the first US bitcoin ETF, opening doors for institutions and their clients. These large accumulations were particularly strong post August 17. This was the day bitcoin\\'s valuation fell over 10%, treading below the $26,000 mark — a value not witnessed since June 2023. Bitcoin invalidated the fleeting gains, spurred by Grayscale\\'s legal win, reverting to values beneath $26,000 by the end of the week. Historical trends hint at potential headwinds in September\\'s bitcoin. Analysts studying the cryptocurrency\\'s seasonal trends point out its historical challenges in September, where it often underperforms and seldom sees gains. While the “whales” continue to accumulate, a different trend is emerging among short-term holders. A notable segment of these short-term participants, particularly those who faced deficits during the recent downturn, have chosen to exit their positions. It underscores the contrast between the speculative nature of these participants and the strategic accumulation approach taken by the bigger stakeholders. The impending U.S. elections add another layer of unpredictability, stoking volatility flames. The month ahead is paved with suspense as political maneuvers could influence market dynamics, echoing past Septembers of subpar bitcoin performance. Nevertheless, in the short term, we may see headwinds, but in the long run, the outlook is positive . Cathie Wood , the founder and CEO of ARK Invest , has consistently vocalized her bullish stance on bitcoin. Her belief in its long-term value potential and her projection of bitcoin reaching staggering valuations in the coming years align with the accumulation patterns we are witnessing from major stakeholders. Endorsements from prominent individuals reinforce the idea that, even with short-term fluctuations and issues like the contraction of the M2 money supply, bitcoin\\'s future trajectory seems promising. In addition, with upcoming halving events, the rapid withdrawal of bitcoin from exchanges, and a potential supply shortage, these setbacks appear to be merely temporary. Those in the know agree: long-term trend is bullish. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Susie Violet Ward Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions'},\n",

Before I proceed any further into the article, I would like to make it blatantly visible that this survey results are based on Google’s approximation of General American Population. NOT the entire global user base of Bitcoin or the world’s\\xa0population in general. Simple math could tell us\\xa0to why we need to pay heed to details: Total world population: 7.3 billion people Total number of unique Bitcoin wallet addresses, from BlockChain.info: 250,000 Divide 250,000/7.3 Billion = Forget the decimal numbers. It is still a very small fraction. Image from Blockchain.info Key Takeaway 84% of survey respondents of the Bitcoin Public Sentiment survey, who are “not too familiar,” “very familiar” & “somewhat familiar” — Never used Bitcoins. Image 2: Familiarity The “MEH” Conclusion Image 3 Looking at the large distribution of opinions in the mid-range of the images 3 &\\xa04, I can see the following\\xa0conclusions: The survey respondents don’t really care if Bitcoin is primarily used for crime, fraud or extortion. The middle band of 33.4% is a loud and clear signal that shouts — “I care about What’s In It For Me” 34.4% of respondents are ‘meh’ to the question on whether “Governments should ban Bitcoin or leave it alone?” Image 4 The same question, “Is Bitcoin used primarily for crime, fraud and extortion, or is it primarily used for legal transfers and investing?” can be rephrased this way — “Is the Dollar primarily used for crime, fraud and extortion, or is it primarily used for legal transfer and investing?” I guess the answer would still be “Meh.” Because, if not bitcoins, what is the current industry standard currency for crime, fraud and extortion? Fiat currencies – obviously. Hence: “Meh.” Images from: Coincenter Survey Page\\xa0and Flickr.

On early Friday, the price recovered somewhat, climbing back to $26.8k before slowly dropping to $25,950. With the weekend’s arrival, Bitcoin recovered slightly, but enough to climb back to $26k and remain above. The coin has been trading sideways ever since. At first, on Saturday, it would often test the support, which led it to $25.8k, or $25.95k. However, the price strengthened on Sunday, and the coin did not drop below the $26k support again. It came close to breaking it a few times, almost sinking to $26,000. However, for the most part, the price remained slightly above this level, and the same is true for Monday, at least for now. At the time of writing, August 21, Bitcoin’s price sits at $26,035. This represents an 11% drop compared to last week but only a 0.2% drop in the previous 24 hours. Currently, ‘sBTC’s price fluctuates between $26k as its support and $26.25k as its new resistance. Can Bitcoin Recover? Bitcoin price has dipped sharply, and historically, any sharp drop is typically followed by an equally strong rebound. Once the price finds its bottom, many tend to rush in to buy the dip, thus creating demand and creating conditions for a recovery. Many Bitcoin traders expect this to happen now, just waiting for Bitcoin to see a growth spurt. More optimistic analysts hope the coin will continue after that, recovering losses and using the momentum to surpass previous highs. Whether or not this will happen remains to be seen. Some have argued that this is where BTC is supposed to be and that the last two months of its price being around $29k or $30k is just a pump caused by the ETF filings. If correct, Bitcoin is technically back on track with this new price drop. On an annual basis, the coin is still 22% up compared to last year, so this drop does not negate all the recovery in the previous eight months. Even so, it does disappoint all those expecting a start of a bull run. Can Bull Run Still Come? Some analysts have pointed out that Bitcoin’s behavior mirrors its 2020 market structure. t the time, the coin went from $16k to $69k in about a year.\\xa0 others have suggested that the coin is likely just taking a breather after its price continuously recovered in the past eight months. If Bitcoin remains true to its pattern, a real bull run will not arrive before next year’s halving, especially since many point out that the new price action will likely discourage an ETF’s approval. Ordinals Make Up 85% of BTC Transactions Over the Weekend One exciting development over the weekend has seen the majority of Bitcoin transactions related to Ordinals. According to reports on Sunday, Bitcoin has seen 530,788 transactions in 24 hours. Round 450,785 of them were Ordinals-related. Over the past 24 hours Bitcoin had 530,788 transactions. 450,785 of those transactions were Ordinals related. In the midst of everyone claiming \"Ordinals are dead\" they have literally accounted for 84.9% of the activity on Bitcoin. You can\\'t make this stuff up. — Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) August 20, 2023 Interestingly, this happened when the crypto community claimed that Ordinals were dead, indicating this is false. The hype surrounding the Ordinals has died down since its launch, but this weekend, Ordinals represented the primary use case of the Bitcoin blockchain. 85% of on-chain bitcoin transactions in the past 24 hours are ordinals related EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT the main usecase of the bitcoin chain is ORDINALS pic.twitter.com/PCZt4if5jf — Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) August 20, 2023 Wall Street Memes Bags Another Million, $26m in Total As the Wall Street Memes presale started approaching its end, those interested in buying the WSM token have doubled. ere days after reaching its $25th million raised, the project raised $26th million, currently sitting on $26.22m raised.

       " {'title': 'Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sentiment Turns Extremely Bearish',\n",
       "  'text': 'Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sentiment Turns Extremely Bearish share on Facebook share on LinkedIn share on Twitter Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are stabilizing after a sell-off on Wednesday. Some analysts expect crypto volatility to remain elevated this month, especially as investors reduced their exposure to other assets deemed to be risky such as equities. Wednesday’s sell-off resulted in $800 million in liquidations, which accelerated price moves. Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position as a safety mechanism due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. That happens primarily in futures trading. Some analysts are watching the recent rise in leverage among bitcoin futures traders, which typically signals more risk in the market. From a technical perspective, bitcoin could see a countertrend bounce , although upside appears to be limited. Latest Prices Bitcoin (BTC): $43,163, -2.41% Ether (ETH): $3,418, -5.71% S&P 500: $4,696, -0.10% Gold: $1,788, -1.20% 10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.72% Bearish sentiment indicator The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which measures sentiment among market participants, is at its lowest level since July. The low reading indicates market fear and is often seen as a contrarian indicator among crypto traders. “The Fear and Greed Index hasn’t signaled greed in more than one and a half months - an unusually long period of negative market sentiment,” Arcane Research wrote in a report. Still, the index can remain in “fear” mode for as long as a month as prices typically move sideways before a decisive move up or down. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index (CoinDesk, Alternative.me) Bitcoin drawdown deepens Bitcoin is roughly 35% below its all-time high of almost $69,000, which was set in November. The drawdown, or percentage decline from peak to trough, is the largest since July. Previous drawdowns have reached levels of nearly 80% and took several months to recover. For now, drawdowns have been less severe over the past year relative to prior extremes. The chart below is from financial data provider Koyfin. Altcoin roundup Polkadot, Solana among biggest losers: The tokens of Ethereum rivals Avalanche (AVAX), Terra (LUNA) and Solana (SOL) – the so-termed ‘SoLunAvax’ trade – fell by as much as 12% in the past 24 hours. Polkadot (DOT), another Ethereum rival, saw its tokens fall by 14% before seeing a slight revival during Asian trading hours on Thursday. Tokens of those networks have risen several hundred percent in the past year, mainly as investors looked for blockchain alternatives outside of Ethereum, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa.

Ethereum decentralized finance ( DeFi ) dominance at risk: The scaling of the Ethereum network, which is needed to maintain its dominance, may arrive too late, JPMorgan said in a report. The final phase of the sharding , which is crucial for scaling the network, won’t arrive before next year. Meanwhile, alternative blockchains such as Terra, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Fantom, Tron and Polygon have been gaining the most market share in the DeFi sector. Dip in decentralized exchange volumes: Despite the recent crypto crash, the total value locked in DeFi tokens has remained stable at around 6% below all-time highs, according to data from Messari . “However, the momentum of the decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have lagged behind other explosive DeFi activities,” Messari wrote in a Thursday newsletter. Monthly DEX volumes remain below previous all-time highs since June.

Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Falls To Lowest Level In Two Months by Best Owie 7 months ago in Bitcoin Reading Time: 3 mins read Bitcoin and the broader crypto market took a hit over the last day, leading to bitcoin falling below $20,000 for the first time in two months. This decline was followed by a tremendous plunge in investor sentiment. The sharp decline saw sentiment drop to negative levels not seen since January. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Sitting In Fear For the last two months, the market was able to recover to as high as $25,000 at one point, leading to a recovery in investor sentiment. As a result, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index moved into the greed territory briefly but all of this has come to an end with the most recent plunge.

Sitting at a score of 34, it shows that investors have once again turned very bearish. The result of this is panic sell-offs as participants in the space try to avoid further losses. Crypto Fear & Greed Index drops to 2-month low | Source: alternative.me It is a long way from last month’s greedy market which peaked at 62 on the index. The last time the market saw such a sharp decline was in May 2022 following the Terra (LUNA) network collapse. Is The Bitcoin Bear Market Back? Looking at historical data, it is possible to deduce that the bear trend will continue from here. As mentioned above, the last time the Crypto Fear & Greed Index saw such a sharp decline was when LUNA collapse, triggering a decline in the price of bitcoin from above $30,000 to below $20,000. If this happens to be a repeat of the previous trend, then bitcoin could continue declining. It is even possible to see another decline below its current cycle low of $15,500. If this happens, the market bottom may be farther away than expected. Interestingly, net flows for the past day have come out to be almost neutral for the top digital assets in the space. According to a Glassnode report, bitcoin exchange inflows came out to $782.9 million versus $796.6 million in outflows leading to negative $13.7 million in net flows. Ethereum recorded the same trend with net flows coming out to negative $29.6 million after all was said and done. 📊 Daily On-Chain Exchange Flow #Bitcoin $BTC ➡️  $782.9M in ⬅️  $796.6M out 📉 Net flow: -$13.7M #Ethereum $ETH ➡️  $498.2M in ⬅️  $527.7M out 📉 Net flow: -$29.6M #Tether (ERC20) $USDT ➡️  $795.4M in ⬅️  $852.6M out 📉 Net flow: -$57.2M https://t.co/dk2HbGwhVw — glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) March 10, 2023 Historically, it has always been more favorable to enter the market when the majority are scared to do so. This could mean that the current downtrend poses a buying opportunity for investors who are looking to get in at low prices.

       " {'title': '3 Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis Tools: How They Work & How to Use Them',\n",
       "  'text': \"3 Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis Tools: How They Work & How to Use Them Cryptonews Exclusives 3 Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis Tools: How They Work & How to Use Them Alex Lielacher @alex-lielacher Jun 27, 2020 7:00 AM EDT Â· 3 min read Alex Lielacher @alex-lielacher m 3 Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis Tools: How They Work & How to Use Them Bitcoin (BTC) sentiment analysis tools can be powerful. Used correctly, they can allow traders and investors to gauge whether crypto markets (and their participants) are feeling bullish or bearish. Source: Adobe/Lyona So, with some claiming that the market is now hovering between bear and bull status, perhaps there is no better time than right now to look at three popular bitcoin sentiment analysis tools. Below, we will take a look at how they work on their own (and perhaps together) – and look at ways you could use them to make smarter trading decisions. Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is arguably the most popular sentiment indicator currently being used in the bitcoin market. It was created by the team behind Alternative.me , who created a solution not unlike CNN ’s Fear & Greed Index. But instead of measuring sentiment in the stock market, like CNN’s tool, it measures crypto investor sentiment. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows whether investors are currently feeling bold or scared using a needle that moves from left to right, with measurements that move between the values of 0 and 100. The lower the value, the more fearful investors are. And the higher the index value, the greedier investors are feeling. Factors that determine the index’s value include volatility, market momentum and volume, social media momentum and bitcoin dominance. How to Use It The Fear & Greed Index is very easy to understand and use. When the index shows that investors are concerned, it may well be a good time to buy. And when people are starting to show signs of greed, you might want to think about selling. If the Fear & Greed Index sinks below 20, fear is prevalent, while a reading of 80+ could mean that smart investors sell while confidence soars. Bulls & Bears Index The Bulls & Bears Index , created by Augmento , is a social media sentiment indicator that shows how bullish or bearish conversations about bitcoin (BTC) are becoming on platforms like Twitter, Reddit and BitcoinTalk. The index shows a value between 0 and 1. This value is computed using a classifier that is trained on crypto-specific language. This tool analyzes social media conversations and is sensitive to 93 different sentiments and topics. How to Use It The Bulls & Bears Index is a social media sentiment indicator that aims to gauge investor mood by analyzing social media mentions. A low score, close to zero, suggests that bitcoin investors are bearish, while a high reading close to 1 suggests that investors are bullish on bitcoin on social media. If you believe in the wisdom of the crowd, then you might want to buy bitcoin when the Bulls & Bear Index starts to climb – and sell when it starts dropping. Bitcoin Sentiment Index The Bitcoin Sentiment Index , developed by Bitts Analytics , is another social media sentiment indicator that aims to provide insight into the way crypto investors feel at any given time. The indicator’s value is computed using machine learning solutions that scan social media posts that mention bitcoin. This may provide fascinating insights. But critics argue that it is difficult to gauge the tool’s viability as it is not immediately clear what factors exactly are taken into account during the computation process. How to Use It The Bitcoin Sentiment Index is a little more complex than both the Fear & Greed Index and the Bulls & Bears Index. However, most traders will likely agree that it is not difficult to read. When the indicator line drops, the market sentiment is turning bearish. And when the indicator’s sentiment line climbs, investors are starting to express more bullish sentiments on social media. How to Trade Bitcoin Using Sentiment Analysis Tools Ultimately, it is important to bear in mind that market sentiment does not always dictate future price developments. Even if, for example, all of the indicators mentioned suggest that now is a good time to buy bitcoin, the price could still fall suddenly due to other factors. Therefore, as discussed further in this article , bitcoin sentiment indicators should ideally be one of many of the tools in your arsenal of crypto market weapons. To use them as the sole basis of your trading strategy could be quite risky. That said, as a trader, building up a wide range of tools will help you make better-educated and more informed estimates about where the market is heading next. As such, getting to grips with one or more of the indicators discussed above could be of help when you are trying to forecast price movements based on trading data from technical indicators. Knowledge, as they say, is power. And the more you know, the more you could potentially earn! Enter your email for our Free Daily Newsletter A quick 3min read about today's crypto news!

Bitcoin Fear And Greed Index Is Pointing At Greed Once Again The “ fear and greed index ” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. The metric measures this sentiment using a numeric scale from zero to a hundred. All values above the 54 mark imply that the investors are greedy right now, while those below the 46 levels suggest the market is fearful currently. The region in between these two zones signifies a territory of neutral sentiment. Besides these sentiments, there are also two “extremes,” called extreme fear (occurs below a value of 25) and extreme greed (above 75). Historically, these zones have been important for the price of BTC, as cyclical bottoms and tops have generally taken shape when the market has held these sentiments. Because of this reason, some traders think that the best times to buy are when the market is showing extreme fear, while the best selling opportunities take place at extreme greed.

This trading strategy is often called “contrarian investing.” Warren Buffet’s famous quote echoes the same idea: “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Now, here is what the Bitcoin fear and greed index looks like at the moment: The sentiment in the BTC and wider crypto sector right now | Source: Alternative As the chart above shows, the fear and greed index currently has a value of 56, which means that the BTC and wider cryptocurrency market sentiment has just stepped inside the greed territory.

The below chart shows how the value of the indicator has changed recently. Looks like the value of the metric has sharply jumped in the last couple of days | Source: Alternative The chart shows that the Bitcoin fear and greed index had surged out of the fear zone when this rally first started in January. Since then, the values fluctuated between the greed and neutral territories for a couple of months until a few days ago when the price plunge lead to the mentality also falling off. However, BTC got out of the fear zone fast, and as the crypto rallied in the past two days, the indicator also shot up. The sentiment towards greed has improved thanks to the price of BTC rocketing today, as the asset has now crossed the $25,000 level . It remains to be seen whether investors will continue to become more optimistic in the coming days or if the sentiment will once again stagnate as it did earlier during the rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $25,900, up 16% in the last week.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Plunged Inside The Fear Region Recently The “ fear and greed index ” is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency market. This metric uses a numeric scale from zero to a hundred to represent this sentiment. When the index has a value greater than 54, the investors share greed. On the other hand, values under 46 imply the presence of fear in the market. The in-between region naturally suggests that the majority mentality is neutral currently. Here is what the Bitcoin fear and greed index looks like right now: The value of the index appears to be 30 at the moment | Source: Alternative As displayed above, the Bitcoin fear and greed index currently has a value of 30, meaning that most investors in the sector share a mentality of fear. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Death Cross: Here’s What Happened Last Time Just yesterday, the indicator had a value of 40, implying that the sentiment has worsened quite a bit during the past day. Looks like the metric's value has sharply declined | Source: Alternative Besides the three core sentiments already discussed, there are also “extreme fear” and “extreme greed.” These two regions of the indicator have been pretty significant historically for the cryptocurrency. The reason is that extreme fear occurs at and under 25 when the major bottoms have formed for the asset’s price. Similarly, the tops have occurred in extreme greed (at and above 75). Bitcoin has generally tended to go against what most investors expect. The extreme regions are when this expectation is the strongest, hence why a reversal occurred. A trading technique called “ contrarian investing ” exploits this apparent pattern. Warren Buffet’s famous quote says, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” The current value of the index (30) is quite close to the extreme fear region, which means that if sentiment worsens further in the coming days, it might drop into this territory. Naturally, if such a drop happens, a contrarian investor might take it as a signal to buy the cryptocurrency.

According to this effect, BTC and other assets usually perform the best between 31 October and 1 May. Those who practice the “sell in May and go away” strategy come back this season to buy back into the asset. It remains to be seen how the Bitcoin sentiment will develop in the coming month and if the Halloween Effect will play any role.

[+] meeting with delegates from the 2019 New Economy Forum at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China November 22, 2019.  (Photo by Jason Lee-Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images Bitcoin has been relatively flat this year, stuck between bull and bear rallies but trading within a range. While far off from COVID-19 highs, it is nowhere near the lows when bitcoin touched just above $16,000 USD per 1 BTC after the fallout of cryptocurrency exchange FTX failing. The halving is traditionally a price-boosting event for bitcoin. Halving is when the reward for miners is reduced in half, so less bitcoin is available. This happens in programmed intervals based on the number of mined bitcoin blocks. The next bitcoin halving will happen around April 24th, 2024, when block number 840,000 is mined. It’s the living embodiment of bitcoin’s creed that the price for a scarce asset will increase as you decrease its supply. Bitcoin’s programmed deflation is the opposite of the inflation that comes with growing fiat monetary supply, like with the US dollar. For example, one year after the 2020 halving, bitcoin’s price was up 533% at one point. Will the same thing happen again? Or will this halving cycle be taken up with another cycle of bad news, such as the implementation in force of China’s proposed cryptocurrency mining ban that pushed prices down soon after in 2021? These are questions I’ve dealt with significantly as part of my research into China and bitcoin . Perhaps no country has affected bitcoin’s price history more than China, but there are several reasons to believe China’s actions might be more neutral for the market until at least the next halving.

Still, one way of thinking about the State Council is that it’s a “super-Executive Branch”, reporting to the Premier, who is the #2 in the Chinese power system behind the General Secretary (currently Xi Jinping), and generally seen as the head of the administrative state - and responsible for regulating and developing economic growth. When the State Council speaks about a topic, other branches of the Chinese government fall quickly into line. Provinces like Sichuan and Inner Mongolia that had previously been dragging their feet and giving bitcoin miners more time to phase their operations out gradually - turned out stricter plans to end bitcoin mining within the province as soon as the State Council weighed in. The Vice Premier who chaired the committee that implemented the effective bitcoin mining ban, Liu He retired from the Politburo. Though he still consults informally on economic matters, it’s unlikely that bitcoin will return to a Politburo-level event as Xi’s state administration and Liu He both focus on a battle of systems and investment flows and “trade and economic matters” with the West. Bitcoin is also recognized as virtual property and a defensible virtual commodity by some Chinese courts - this has been the case in the Chinese court system for many years. China’s regulations on cryptocurrencies are known as the “Key Prohibition Rules”: it is illegal to act as a central counterparty for the exchange of cryptocurrencies for legal tender or each other, and it is unlawful to raise funding through ICOs. Thus, no bitcoin exchange exists at scale headquartered in China. There is also a strict ban on using cryptocurrencies as legal tender or circulating currency. The right for Chinese citizens to hold bitcoin as a virtual commodity, though, has been affirmed by multiple courts. It’s unlikely the Chinese party-state will go after people who hold bitcoin and are Chinese citizens due to the mix of virtual property protections and bans being focused on the use of bitcoin as legal tender but implemented on the application rather than network level. This means that centralized businesses like exchanges and bitcoin miners are targeted. But individuals who hold bitcoin, and maybe run a bitcoin node, are still not. China, so far, hasn’t adopted the most extreme measures it could to stamp out bitcoin as a result. While those looking to do bitcoin mining should beware as there have been confiscation of bitcoin miners for power usage, there haven’t been widespread seizures of bitcoin from Chinese citizens or a Great Firewall level ban on the protocol ports. While the Chinese state has made it difficult to buy bitcoin with Yuan, using Tether and buying bitcoin with it is still an open secret for OTC exchanges. The likely disruption here will come if more exchanges or a major stablecoin fails rather than the Chinese state’s actions. The Chinese party-state might have to react if that’s the case - but there are likely very few actions it’ll take proactively for the moment, as no announcements are on the horizon (while the Chinese party-state had warned of the bitcoin mining ban for years). Hong Kong And Shanghai Two pieces of “bullish” Chinese bitcoin news have come out recently. First is the Shanghai court ruling, which, while being a bit more nuanced on Bitcoin being separate from cryptocurrencies, more or less follows the same trendline of Chinese courts recognizing that bitcoin and other digital assets are commodities and worthy of protection from seizure under China’s civil code. In Hong Kong, there are signs a need for capital inflows has led to Hong Kong embracing cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s perhaps a way to push forward the idea that in Hong Kong, it’s “business as usual” after protests asking for universal suffrage froze the city. However, there are early signs of trouble as Hong Kong-based JPEX failed. JPEX is an unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange and not one that went through the new proposed regulatory structure. Nevertheless, it is probably a reason for Hong Kong’s executive branch to get involved - which probably doesn’t auger well for the licensing regime, which securities regulators and the central bank mostly pushed forward. Exporting Philosophy An underrated aspect of how China can affect bitcoin prices is the export of its ideology. China was one of the first state movers to try to clamp down on bitcoin, partly due to its sensitivity to capital controls in a closed system and also due to the large amount of bitcoin mining activity within its borders. The same arguments about proof-of-work bitcoin being energy-wasteful are already popping up in individual states of the United States such as New York State’s temporary ban on certain bitcoin mining activities and European legislation . Other states may soon follow in China’s footsteps, which will have the effect of moving bitcoin’s price, as those differences will be newer than what China is likely to do now. The Next Halving Usually, a halving event will increase bitcoin’s price - however, it’s more uncertain this time whether that’ll be the case. It’ll be the first halving for China since the bitcoin mining ban came into play. While Chinese social media used to light up with each bitcoin halving because of the large amount of bitcoin miners present in China, it’s possible 2024 will be a bit more dull. It’s unlikely that major Chinese political events will shape bitcoin prices until then, though there might be more demand for bitcoin as capital flight takes hold across the country.

Zoom in with touchscreen: Touch and hold with ONE finger then drag. Zoom in on desktop: Left click and drag. Reset: Double click. Access Indicator Alerts CSV data download Indicator Overview By comparing the 28 day change in price (%) with the 28 day change in active addresses (%) for Bitcoin we are able to create a short-term sentiment indicator called AASI (Active Address Sentiment Indicator). Grey lines on the chart show the change in active addresses. On the outer boundaries of those grey lines are standard deviation bands. Dotted red line = upper boundary Dotted green line = lower boundary Orange line is the 28 day price change (%). When the orange line reaches the upper boundary (red dotted line) it is indicating that short term market sentiment is overheated.  Because the rate of increase in price is outstripping the rate of increase in active addresses. Zooming in on the chart (left click and drag) we can see that this often corresponds with $BTC price (blue line) stalling and/or retracing. The opposite is true when the 28 day price change hits the lower boundary (green dotted line).  Here market sentiment is overly bearish and we often see $BTC price then increasing thereafter. In extreme market conditions the 28 day price change (orange line) aggressively breaks out beyond the dotted red and green bands.  This is typically in a major market crash or in the latter stages of a bull market.  I may add additional standard deviation bands to catch these moves but for now have left them off to keep the chart clean. Pre 2015 data is quite volatile and messy so this charts starts at 01 January 2015. Bitcoin Price Prediction Using This Tool Unlike many of the other Bitcoin live charts, this live chart examines lower time frames and attempts to provide a Bitcoin price prediction in terms of directional moves on weekly timeframes. So it tries to do a Bitcoin price forecast by highlighting where price may pullback or where it may bounce using price and active address data.

BTC Fails at $26K Bitcoin’s price performance has been anything but impressive for the past 10 days or so, ever since it shot up by $2,000 and then dumped by almost $3,000 days later after Grayscale’s win over the SEC. The subsequent violent rejection pushed the asset to an 11-week low of $25,350. The bulls finally stepped up at that point and helped bitcoin recover some ground by the time last weekend had arrived. As such, BTC stood calmly at under $26,000. The following days, including most of the business week, went by uneventfully, with the cryptocurrency stuck at the same spot. It finally made a move upwards yesterday when it pumped to a multi-day high at over $26,400. Alicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?

Its market cap is still just inches above $500 billion, and its dominance over the alts is back down to 48.3%. BTCUSD.

Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, Tron, Polkadot, Polygon, and Shiba Inu have all declined by up to 1%. More losses come from the likes of Binance Coin, Cardano, Litecoin, and Solana, with SOL dropping by about 2%. Stellar’s native token is the only notable exception from the larger-cap alts. XLM is up by over 4% in a day and trades above $0.13. Naturally, the total market cap has also lost yesterday’s gains and is back down to $1.040 trillion on CMC. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Caroline Ellison And SBF's Plot To Suppress BTC Under $20K Crypto Investor Sentiment Returns To Bitcoin All-Time High Levels by Best Owie 7 months ago in Bitcoin 0 Crypto investors are becoming more greedy with the price of Bitcoin breaking the $28,000 resistance. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has now returned to levels not seen since November 2021, which was right around the time when the price of BTC hit its all-time high. Crypto Investors Are Very Greedy Since 2023 began, crypto investor sentiment has been on a slow but steady uptrend. It finished the year 2022 in the ‘Extreme Fear’ territory which saw prices drop to new cycle lows. However, the change so far has been encouraging as the index has now returned to the ‘Greed’ level. Related Reading: Cardano Gearing Up For Recovery As ADA Whales Become Active Again On Tuesday, the Fear & Greed Index hit a new 2023 high of 68, which brought it closer to ‘Extreme Greed’ than it has ever been. Now, this sentiment analysis is important because it helps to tell how investors are feeling toward the market. When the index is in fear which is a score between 0-47, it shows that investors are very wary of the market, hence new money isn’t flowing into the market. But when the index is in greed, from 53-100, it means investors are very greedy and are more likely to invest. Crypto Fear & Greed Index recovers to November 2021 levels | Source: alternative.me This means that the index hitting 68 signals that crypto investors are looking favorably toward the market. Since investors are more likely to take risks when they are feeling more optimistic, it can usually translate to higher prices as the market sees more liquidity. But Will Bitcoin Rally Following Favorable Sentiment? During times when the Fear & Greed Index has entered the greed territory, there has usually price uptrends that are recorded at the time due to the heightened positive sentiment in the market. Given this, there is a possibility that Bitcoin will continue its uptrend, and probably break the $30,000 resistance. However, just as with the crypto market, the possibility of a downtrend from here cannot be completely eliminated. This is because sometimes, periods of high positive sentiment can also signal a top, as it did back in November 2021. As such, investors could dump as they take advantage of the gains so far.

A similar trend was established back in August 2020 right at the start of the bull market, so this could play out in the same way.

Now, as the Federal Reserve grapples with a $33 trillion U.S. \"debt death spiral,\" Jefferies\\' analysts have warned the Fed will be forced to restart its money printer—potentially collapsing the U.S. dollar and fueling a bitcoin price boom to rival gold.

[+] balance sheet expansion, predicting the bitcoin price and gold will boom. getty \"G7 central banks, including most importantly the Federal Reserve, will not be able to exit from unconventional monetary policy in a benign manner and will ultimately remain committed to ongoing central bank balance-sheet expansion in one form or another,\" Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, wrote in a note to clients seen by CNBC , calling bitcoin and gold \"critical hedges\" against the return of inflation. The Fed began the laborious task of shrinking its swollen near-$9 trillion balance sheet in the spring of 2022 following huge expansion though the Covid-19 pandemic and economically disastrous lockdowns. So-called quantitative tightening sees the Fed suck liquidity out the financial system, passing on the burden of freshly issued debt to the private sector. As well as reducing its balance sheet, the Fed has been hiking interest rates at a historic clip as it struggles to bring soaring inflation under control, creating what some fear could become a counter-intuitive \"death spiral\" for the U.S. dollar that ultimately pushes up the bitcoin price . 10/10 update: Analysts at Wall Street giant Deutsche Bank have warned the world could be headed for 1970s stagflation, where inflation remains elevated alongside a lack of economic growth. \"So given inflation is still above its pre-pandemic levels, it is important not to get complacent about its path,\" macro strategist Henry Allen and research analyst Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace of Deutsche Bank wrote in a note seen by MarketWatch . \"After all, if there is another shock and inflation remains above target into a third or even a fourth year, it is increasingly difficult to imagine that long-term expectations will repeatedly stay lower than actual inflation.\" The analysts pointed to soaring oil prices following the outbreak of war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, as well as an increase in worker strikes this year and meteorological trouble brewing for commodity prices thanks to the El Niño weather pattern. The Fed could be forced to suddenly flip dovish in the face of a U.S. recession due to a larger-than-usual lag in the Fed\\'s inflation reducing interest rate hikes following the money supply explosion through 2020 and 2021, according to Wood. \"Such a failure to exit from unorthodox monetary policy in a benign manner is likely to culminate in the collapse of the U.S.-dollar paper standard to the benefit of both gold bullion owners and also owners of bitcoin,\" Wood wrote.

Caroline Ellison And SBF's Plot To Suppress BTC Under $20K Bitcoin Sentiment Turns Neutral As BTC Plunges Below $29,000 by Keshav Verma 6 months ago in Bitcoin 0 Data shows the Bitcoin market sentiment has turned neutral today as the price of the cryptocurrency has taken a plunge below the $29,000 level. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Retreated To “Neutral” Territory The “ Fear & Greed Index ” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. This metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for representing this sentiment. All values of the index above the 50 mark imply that investors are greedy currently, while those below this threshold suggest the market is fearful right now. While this split may be even in theory, the territory on the boundary of these ranges is generally considered to belong to a “neutral” sentiment. To be more specific, the values between 46-54 may signify a neutral market. Besides these three sentiments, there are also two other “extreme” ones, namely “extreme fear” and “extreme greed.” The former of these occur at values less than 25 and holds significance as the region where cyclical bottoms have historically formed for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Back In Accumulation Mode, Buy 20,000 BTC Similarly, the latter region, which takes place above a value of 75, is where tops have generally taken shape for the market. Because of this apparent relationship with the price, some investors believe it’s best to buy during extreme fear and sell during extreme greed. Followers of this idea are called “contrarian investors,” as they go against the grain to make their moves. Warren Buffet ‘s famous quote also echoes the same philosophy: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Now, here is a chart that shows how the Fear & Greed Index’s value has changed for the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market during the last year: The value of the metric seems to have plunged during the past day | Source: Alternative As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index had mostly been inside the fear and extreme fear territory during the bear market , but with the rally that started this year, the indicator sharply recovered to neutral values. Since then, the metric has been able to maintain at or above neutral values, except for a temporary plunge back inside the fear zone last month. However, in the past few weeks, the market had been able to hold a constant sentiment of greed as the asset’s price rode a strong bullish momentum. Over the last couple of days, the investor mentality has taken a hit following the plummet in the BTC price below first the $30,000 level, and now the $29,000 level. Related Reading: Crypto Futures Sees $236 Million Liquidations As Bitcoin Plunges To $29,300 Currently, the metric still has a value of 52, which suggests that the sentiment is still not far off from the greed territory. However, this shift towards neutrality is still notable, as the last time the indicator had similar values was more than a month ago. It now remains to be seen whether the market can regain its optimism, or if the decline in the sentiment would continue in the near future, and the metric would sink back inside the fear zone.

The Fear and Greed Index is a tool that helps investors and traders analyze the Bitcoin and Crypto market from a sentiment perspective. It identifies the extent to which the market is becoming overly fearful or overly greedy.  Hence why it is called the Fear and Greed Index. The idea is that when the market is generally overly fearful, it may indicate that Bitcoin is cheap/undervalued at that time and could present a good buying opportunity. The reverse also applies, so when the Fear and Greed Index is signaling market participants are extremely greedy, it may indicate the price of Bitcoin is too high above its intrinsic value and it could be a good time to sell. Why Is The Fear And Greed Index Useful For Investors And Traders? Understanding the scores from the Index could present an opportunity to the astute investor to buy when the market is overly fearful and sell when the market is extremely greedy.  Thereby potentially improving their investment decisions. This indicator would show red numbers and state \\'extreme fear\\' when market sentiment is extremely negative.  It would show green numbers and \\'extreme greed\\' when sentiment and market momentum are extremely positive. The Fear and Greed Index can therefore act as a useful emotional management tool.  Allowing the investor to separate their own emotions from the rest of the market and avoiding any irrational reaction to sudden price movements and market volatility. This is especially the case when it is used alongside other tools that use different data inputs from the market, many of which can be found here . How To Use Fear And Greed Index To Understand Market Sentiments The Fear and Greed Index is on a simple 0 to 100 scale and color-coded accordingly where 0 is red and 100 is green. When the score is red and close to zero this signals extreme fear and could indicate that many Bitcoin ($BTC) and crypto investors are too concerned about the price dropping further. At this point in time crypto fear is high and investors may not be thinking rationally. When the score is green and close to 100 this signals extreme greed and could indicate that many investors of Bitcoin ($BTC) and crypto are too excited about the prices rising a lot further in the future. How To Interpret The Fear And Greed Chart Above, we not only show the Bitcoin index score but also overlay it on top of the price of Bitcoin on the chart. The benefit of this is that it allows you to see not only the current score but also to see how the score has changed with price over time. This adds a new, unique dimension to the Bitcoin Crypto Fear and Greed Index that allows investors to understand how the Index interacts with price historically. This can only be found on this page and is not on any other website we know of that has information about the Fear and Greed Index. We will continually update this live chart every day so you can come back to see how the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is changing alongside the price of Bitcoin over time. We hope you enjoy using this unique and free feature. Data Source Inputs For Generating The Fear and Greed Index Chart The inputs for the Fear and Greed Index are generated every day from several different sources. Each one is relevant in its own way and contributes to a greedy definition and to help define fear within the greed and fear index.

       "  'text': \"Bitcoin Price Prediction 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 - 2030 Story Highlights Bitcoin price today is 26,745.8738 If Bitcoin sustains above $26K, the BTC price prediction for 2023 predicts it to reach $35,000. The Bitcoin price forecast 2030 projects a meteoric recovery in BTC price to reach $347,783. Riding higher on the Uptober rally, the Bitcoin price is undermining multiple bearish spots and overcoming the overhead supply. Moreover, with the high chances of the SEC approving the Bitcoin ETF application, the sentiments are fueling a hopium rally. Following the high volatility of September, the buyers are ready to drive BTC price to higher levels with the aim of preparing for the Bitcoin halving rally next year. Despite the recent recovery, the oldest crypto is significantly below its all-time high of $69,000. Nevertheless, 2023 proves bullish for Bitcoin, as it registers a 71.85% YTD growth. Consequently, this demonstrates the resilience and potential of the biggest cryptocurrency in the global financial network and how it can transform the future. However, the market is still filled with doubts like: “Is Bitcoin ready to cross the $30K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin ever go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” To solve such doubts, we bring our comprehensive Bitcoin price prediction 2023-2030. So, are you ready to explore the BTC price prediction for 2023-2030 and find out if will bitcoin go back up to $100K?

SEC’s Delay on Bitcoin ETF Decision : Firstly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications until October. Applicants Affected : Consequently, the delay affects several applicants, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Wise Origin, VanEck, Bitwise, and Valkyrie Digital Assets. Review Timeline : To provide context, the SEC began examining the latest batch of applications, which came from both cryptocurrency-focused and traditional finance firms, the previous month. Moreover, the SEC is taking its time to scrutinize each application carefully. Extended Comment Periods : Interestingly, the SEC has chosen not to make a definitive decision at this time. Instead, they’ve prolonged the existing comment periods, allowing for more public feedback on the applications. New Deadlines: Wise Origin, Galaxy, and WisdomTree: Now, these applicants have until October 17 to await the SEC’s decision. Valkyrie : On the other hand, Valkyrie’s new deadline stands at October 19. Bitwise : Similarly, Bitwise too, must wait until October 16 for the SEC’s verdict. D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling : Notably, earlier in the week, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals determined that some of the SEC’s reasons for declining bitcoin ETF applications appeared “arbitrary and capricious.” Therefore, this has raised questions about the SEC’s decision-making process. Grayscale’s Argument : This significant ruling came after Grayscale contended that the SEC lacked a solid foundation for denying its proposal to transform the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Additionally, this has added another layer of complexity to the ongoing debate. US lawmakers urge the SEC to approve ET Fs: The lawmakers said that following a recent court decision, there is no reason to continue to deny such applications under inconsistent and discriminatory standards. Finally, they urged SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve the listing of spot bitcoin ETPs immediately. Bitcoin Price Prediction for October 2023 Making a stronger comeback in October, the Bitcoin price skyrocketed 3.82% on the first day and plans to continue the bullish trend. The trendline breakout ends the short-term correction phase in BTC price action and reclaims the 50-day EMA. The sudden jump forms a bullish engulfing candle and surpasses the $28K mark. Moreover, the rising Bitcoin price gives a bullish breakout of an inverted head and shoulders pattern, with the neckline at the $27K mark. Trading View As the overall market and sentiments toward Bitcoin improve, BTC price may shortly rise to the overhead ceiling at $30K. Moreover, the price jump increases the chances of 50 and 200-day EMAs regaining the bullish alignment. If the uptrend continues, then the BTC price can rise higher above the $30K mark. With the SEC ready to decide on the Bitcoin ETF applications, the bullish momentum is expected to rise even more. In such conditions, the BTC price may reach the $35K mark. On the downside, a fall below $26,274 could trigger a sharp decline to either $25,600 or $24,900 in a worst-case scenario. Therefore, traders should keep a close eye on these key levels. On-chain Analysis Firstly, Exchange Inflow Volume: The total inflow volume stands at 38,071.66 BTC, marking a 14.825% increase in the last 24 hours. Next, The Exchange Deposits: The number of deposits has slightly risen by 2.242%, totaling 48,060. Moreover, Exchange Outflow Volume: The total outflow volume has surged to 42,706.09 BTC, experiencing a significant 21.783% increase. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction October 2023 $24,900 $29,950 $35,000 Also Read: What is Bitcoin? An In-Depth Guide To The King Of Digital Currencies Bitcoin Price Prediction 2023 In a surprising turn of events, Bitcoin’s price soared last night in Asian markets, forming an impressive green candle. Interestingly, this surge comes as U.S. lawmakers urge the SEC to greenlight Bitcoin spot ETFs, stating that there’s no valid reason for further delays. Consequently, this overnight rally has had a ripple effect on the altcoin market, which has also seen a reversal, driven by the upbeat market sentiment. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $26,975, experiencing a slight intraday dip of 0.19%. This suggests that if there may be some resistance above the EMAs, then it can possibly lead to a trendline retest before the bullish trend gains momentum. Therefore, the BTC may shortly bounce back as investors line up at the $27K mark. Moreover, a bullish breakout of $30K can help the BTC price reach $40,000 by the end of 2023. On the flip side, if the downtrend continues below $25,000, then the BTC will plunge price to $24,900.

Bitcoin Market Price Prediction: Analyst and Influencer’s BTC Price Prediction Firm Name 2023 2024 2025 Gov.Capital $60,716 $91,245 $123,352 DigitalCoinPrice $67,119 $78,717 $110,963 Trading Beasts $47,363 $88, 632 $154,435 Blockware Solutions Predict Bitcoin Post-Halving Price To Reach $400,000.

Blockstream CEO Adam Back predicts Bitcoin to hit an all-time high of over $100,000 in 2024. Bitcoin Halving Price Prediction Firstly, the Bitcoin ‘halving’ just took place, an event that happens roughly every four years. Essentially, the reward Bitcoin miners receive for validating transactions gets cut in half. Consequently, this curtails the number of new Bitcoins in circulation, usually sparking a price rally. According to data, the price surges after previous halvings. Therefore, let’s watch this space. Event Date Reward (BTC) Mined (BTC) Launch January 2009 50 10,500,000 Halving 1 November 2012 25 5,250,000 Halving 2 July 2016 12.5 2,625,000 Halving 3 May 2020 6.25 1,312,500 Halving 4 March 2024 3.125 656,250 Halving 5 Expected 2028 1.5625 328,125 Halving 6 Expected 2032 0.78125 164,063 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we’re feeling positive about Bitcoin’s price going up. Significantly, one big reason is the upcoming Bitcoin “halving” event. In simple terms, every four years, the number of new Bitcoins entering the market gets cut in half. Consequently, this usually makes the price go up because there’s less supply. Additionally, Grayscale Investments winning a key legal battle with the SEC improves the chances of a Bitcoin ETF. However, the moves are delayed to October, providing buyers the perfect opportunity to buy and hoard at lower levels. Furthermore, even big names like Standard Chartered Bank and other experts also think Bitcoin’s price will rise soon with the halving on the horizon. Therefore, we’re not alone in our optimism! We expect the BTC price to create a new 2023 high of $35,000 by 2023. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2023 $20,115 $27,557 $35,000 ChatGPT Predicts Bitcoin Post-Halving Price To Cross $1 Million Furthermore, using the above Bitcoin Halving table, we asked ChatGPT to calculate the potential jump in Bitcoin after the 2024 halving. Utilizing Arithmetic and Geometric Progression, respectively, ChatGPT calculates the Bitcoin price prediction for 2024 post-halving to be a 290% and 4,160% jump. Rounding off the current Bitcoin price to $26,000, firstly, the calculations display the post-halving Bitcoin to skyrocket drastically. Specifically, reaching $101,400 by A.P. and $1,107,808 by G.P., Bitcoin is set to create a new high in 2024. Many influencers and Bitcoin maximalists are predicting the BTC price to reach $1M, but the chances of them using G.P. are less, but not zero. Bitcoin Historic Price Sentiments 2008 – 2022 Analyzing the historic price sentiment of BTC is suitable for rightly interpreting the indications we come across while analyzing its future price sentiment.

Social media, such as Twitter, plays a significant role as a meaningful indicator in forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices. Keywords: sentiment analysis ; Twitter ; COVID-19 ; VADER scoring ; correlation 1. Introduction Recent research studies have emerged that involve the impact of COVID-19 on the financial market, including cryptocurrencies [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]. It was illustrated that Bitcoin is not a safe haven [ 1 , 2 ]. A correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market is observed in [ 3 , 4 ]. In [ 5 ], authors performed a dynamic correlation analysis that illustrated that Bitcoin could not hedge the US stocks’ extraordinary tail risk. The co-movement between Bitcoin and daily data of COVID-19 world deaths is examined in [ 6 ]. The herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market has been explored in [ 7 ]. The association between the stock market volatility and policy responses to the COVID-19 outbreak is studied in [ 8 ]. Previous work before the pandemic has used various machine learning algorithms to predict the bitcoin price. In [ 9 ], Arti Jain et al. attempted to predict the prices of Bitcoin and Litecoin two hours in advance based on the sentiments expressed in current tweets. They investigated if social factors could predict the prices of cryptocurrencies. They used a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to predict a bihourly average price from the number of positive, neutral, and negative tweets accumulated every two hours. Symeonidis et al. compared the significance of different preprocessing techniques for sentiment analysis of tweets [ 10 ]. They used four different machine learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine, and a Convolutional Neural Network to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. They tested 16 different preprocessing techniques in isolation. They recommended using lemmatization, replacing repeated punctuation, replacing contractions, or removing numbers. They identified the five most impactful techniques for use in a second. Based on their results, they suggested replacing URLs and user mentions, replacing contractions, replacing repeated punctuation, and lemmatization for a neural network classification model. Ibrahim et al. [ 11 ] provided a predictive model to the BTC prices using Bayesian autoregression models. In Tan and Kashef [ 12 ], a comparative study between various BTC prediction models is performed, showing the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) efficiency in forecasting the Bitcoin price. None of the above research studies have examined the impact of the emotions expressed about bitcoin on social media platforms, such as Twitter, during the COVID-19 outbreak. The preprocessing of tweets is a significant challenge in providing and building an acute prediction model. Feeding text data that do not correlate well with Bitcoin to a prediction model will not allow the right forecasting of Bitcoin’s behavior. The purpose of this paper is to perform a complete Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)-based sentiment analysis of BTC tweets during the era of COVID-19 to identify the role of different preprocessing strategies in predicting Bitcoin prices. The sentiment analysis includes converting tweet text into a sentiment score that is representative of its emotion. Such a task is suited to VADER, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that can deal with the syntax usually adopted on social media. We developed 13 different preprocessing strategies for BTC tweets. To rank the preprocessing strategy’s effectiveness, an overall correlation value, the Average Feature Correlation Magnitude (AFCM), is constructed. For each strategy, the correlation values of all optimum features are averaged by their absolute value. The optimum preprocessing strategies are quantified using VADER scoring systems. The VADER score is used to match the actual BTC price trend. Among all strategies, it was found that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , a discussion on sentiment analysis is presented; Section 3 presents related work on tweets sentiments. In Section 4 , a Complete Sentiment Analysis using VADER scoring of BTC Tweets during the era of COVID-19 is discussed; Section 5 concludes the paper and provides future research directions. 2. Sentiment Analysis In this section, some of the well-known sentiment analysis methods are discussed, including VADER [ 13 ], Word2vec [ 14 ], TFIDF [ 15 ], and N-grams [ 16 ]. 2.1. Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) VADER is a lexicon- and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that can handle words, abbreviations, slang, emoticons, and emojis commonly found in social media [ 13 ]. It is typically much faster than machine learning algorithms, as it requires no training [ 13 , 17 ]. Each body of text produces a vector of sentiment scores with negative, neutral, positive, and compound polarities [ 13 ]. The negative, neutral, and positive polarities are normalized to be between 0 and 1. The compound polarity can be thought of as an aggregate measure of all the other sentiments, normalized to be between −1 (negative) and 1 (positive). 2.2. Word to Vector (Word2vec) In the Word2vec method, embedding words are designed as vectors made of real-valued numbers [ 14 ]. These vectors preserve both the syntactic regularity by making similar words have similar vectors and the semantic regularity between word pairs through vector algebra. For example, the word vector for “man” subtracted from the word vector for “king” and added to the word vector for “woman” produces something very similar to the word vector for “queen”. Such vectors provide a way of translating words to numbers for train machine learning algorithms while preserving the relationships between words. Word2vec was initially developed by Tomas Mikolov et al. [ 14 ] to produce high-quality word vectors more efficiently than conventional means. A shallow feed-forward neural network trains weights with only input, projection, and output layers as word vectors. Two different network architectures, CBOW and Skip-gram, were used to generate the word vectors. CBOW is optimized to guess a target word from adjacent words in the text, while Skip-gram is optimized to guess adjacent words surrounding a target word. 2.3. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) The TFIDF approach finds keywords for each document in a collection of documents [ 15 , 16 , 18 ]. It assigns a number to each word in a document based on how frequently it appears in that document and how many documents use it. The “term-frequency” of a word is the number of times that word appears in a document, while the “document frequency” is the number of documents that contain that word [ 18 ]. The “inverse document frequency” of a word is the natural logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the word’s “document frequency”. Each word is assigned a TFIDF score by multiplying the word’s “term frequency” by its “inverse document frequency”. 2.4. N-Gram N-gram is a model describing the identification of all groups of n adjacent words in a body of text [ 16 ]. For example, all adjacent triplets’ words in the sentence “Mary had a little lamb” are “Mary had a”, “had a little”, and “a little lamb”. These groupings are known as trigrams. However, groupings can be defined for any integer size. Unigrams, or single word groups, would include “Mary”, “had”, “a”, “little,”, and “lamb”. Bigrams, or pairs of words, would include “Mary had”, “had a”, “a little”, and “little lamb”. Using bigger n-grams in a sentiment dictionary may help improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis when handling negations. 3. Related Work and Background In [ 19 ], a correlation between sentiment analysis using current Bitcoin tweets and future Bitcoin price fluctuations was investigated. Based solely on sentiment changes, the naive prediction model achieves 83% accuracy with very few predictions. Authors in [ 20 ] show that Twitter sentiment and message volume could predict the price fluctuations of multiple cryptocurrencies, while Twitter bot accounts could potentially spread cryptocurrency misinformation. A modified VADER algorithm classified the tweet sentiments of nine cryptocurrencies’ as buying, holding, or selling. Their experimental outcome showed that the daily intervals of Twitter sentiments and message volumes are stronger predictors than the buying to selling ratio. T. R. Li et al. [ 21 ] have attempted to demonstrate that Twitter’s sentiments help in predicting cryptocurrency price changes. They have trained an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression tree model (XGBoost) with Twitter sentiments to predict price changes. Six hourly variables for positive, negative, neutral, unweighted, retweet weighted sentiments, and trading volume were produced from the collected datasets. In [ 22 ], The VADER sentiment analysis algorithm was used to assign each tweet a compound sentiment score based on how positive, negative, or neutral their words were. The final sentiment score factored in the number of Twitter followers, likes, and retweets associated with each tweet. The current closing price of Bitcoin, final sentiment score, and the moving average of the last 100 data points were used as input variables for the model. C. Kaplan et al. [ 23 ] researched if rumors and speculation in social media can influence cryptocurrencies and price changes. Precisely, they gauged the dependence between the unstable cryptocurrency prices on Twitter sentiments. The six cryptocurrencies chosen were Agrello, Bread, Bytecoin, Digibyte, Doge coin, and Icos. Regression analysis was performed to test the dependence of daily cryptocurrency prices on daily Twitter sentiment. Significance F and R 2 values were calculated for each cryptocurrency. Bread and Bytecoin showed the lowest R 2 scores, while other coins had scores above 0.22. Agrello, Bytecoin, and Icos all had prominent F scores below 0.05. They concluded that some unstable cryptocurrencies might show dependence on Twitter sentiments. Sailunaz and Alhajj [ 24 ] created user recommendations for Twitter Users or topics. They showed that analyzing the full text from tweets proved to be better than exploring full text from tweets with only nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs (NAVA). Their work involved providing sentiment scores, a reply network, and a follower network from the tweets to estimate machine learning recommendations. A Naïve Bayes classifier proved to work better than a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or a Random Forest (RF) under k-fold cross-validation [ 25 ]. The sentiment scores of the full text were a minimum of 5% better than NAVA text under 3-, 5-, and 10-fold cross-validation. The best score was 66.86%, obtained from the 10-fold cross-validation of a Naïve Bayes classifier on full text. Hanjia Lyu et al. [ 26 ] characterized Twitter users who use controversial terms when mentioning COVID-19 on Twitter and trained various machine learning algorithms for classifying users. 4. A Complete Sentiment Analysis of BTC Tweets During the Era of COVID-19 This paper aims to identify modifications on the tweet text during preprocessing so that the resulting sentiment scores best correlated with Bitcoin’s closing prices. We created different ways of preprocessing text for VADER scoring and tested them on truncated and full-length tweets. 4.1. Data Collection We gathered tweets for sentiment analysis by developing a custom tweet scraper using Twitter API. We chose to collect data for three main reasons manually. All existing online free datasets did not include the COVID-19 pandemic period. All web scrapers were avoided because they might bypass the restrictions of the Twitter API. These restrictions were meant to protect Twitter users. We followed twitters rules [ 27 , 28 ], and we coded our tweet scraper in Python using the Tweepy library to access the Twitter API [ 29 ]. In our experiments, the collection method obtained a representative set of BTC tweets during the COVID-19 period. The tweet selection involved filtering tweets by a manually chosen set of keywords. Tweets that contained any keywords related to bitcoin (“bitcoin”, “bitcoins”, “Bitcoin”, “Bitcoins”, “BTC”, “XBT”, and “satoshi”) or any hashtags of Bitcoin’s ticker symbols (“#XBT”, “ $ XBT”, “#BTC”, and “ $ BTC”) were collected. Raw tweet text and their timestamps were stored. Timestamps were provided at a temporal resolution to the nearest second. As Twitter truncates tweets over 140 characters, the full-length version of those tweets was also collected [ 30 , 31 , 32 ]. A total of 4,169,709 tweets were collected from 8:47 AM, 22 May to 11:59 PM, 10 July. The volume of tweets collected for each date was observed to vary based on how old the requested data are, as shown in Figure 1 . Bitcoin prices are obtained for free from the CryptoCompare API [ 32 ]. They provide open historical data of opening, high, low, and closing prices and volume (OHLCV) information at a temporal resolution of every minute [ 33 ]. Minutely, Bitcoin data were obtained over hourly data to provide enough data points to analyze. About 71,472 min of data points was collected from 22 May to 10 July, while collecting hourly prices would have provided nearly 1191 data points. Timestamps of Bitcoin prices and OHLCV data were then stored. The recorded OHLCV data from (Cryptocompare.com) seemed to fluctuate when prices were still recent. Data were provided up to 33 h into the past (based on our tests). A bi-daily collection routine was used to replace any recent prices (near the start of the collection period) that matched timestamps with any older prices from the next collection period. 4.2. Data Preprocessing Preprocessing was performed on the text from each tweet converted into an average polarity score and tweet polarity volume per minute. This involves combining three main text cleaning functions labeled “cleaned,” “split,”, and “no sw”. Respectively, they managed the removal of tweet-specific syntax, splitting text into sentences, and removing stopwords. The “cleaned” and “split” functions were tested in different orders, with and without the presence of the “no sw” function at the end. All three preprocessing functions affected the VADER sentiment analysis of text in different ways. Each had the potential to significantly help VADER capture a different aspect of sentiment from the text. The “cleaned” function removed unwanted characters and words used specifically on Twitter’s platform, such as hyperlinks, numbers, and tweet specific syntax, using regular expressions. The removal was applied to preserve emojis and possible emoticon characters for use in the VADER sentiment analyzer. Before removing any alphanumeric chars, the ellipsis mark “…” was removed from the end of tweet text truncated to fit within 140 characters. Additionally, HTML entities such as “&amp;” were converted to UTF-8 equivalent characters, such as “&”. Then hyperlinks starting with the characters “http” or “www.” were removed. Numbers, along with any symbols, punctuation, or units next to them, were removed. Finally, the tweet-specific syntax was removed. This syntax included mentions of usernames of the form “@username,” hashtags of the form “#hashtag” and the start of retweets of the form “RT @username.” Once the cleaning phase was completed as shown in Figure 2 , each tweet was represented by words, whitespace, emojis, and other non-alphanumeric characters. Due to the difficulty of creating a regular expression to recognize all emoticons in VADER’s lexicon [ 34 ], these characters were left unchanged. Therefore, the “cleaned” text attempted to leave everything that VADER could use in sentiment analysis unchanged. The “no sw” function in Figure 3 tokenizes text into words and removes any stopwords that VADER’s dictionary does not use. Removing stop words from text requires a tokenized text into a list of words. The tokenization of text into words involves separating continuous blocks of alphabetical characters from the rest of the text. Blocks of continuous whitespace mark our word boundaries, split by Python’s split () function [ 35 ]. Removing all non-alphabetical characters would solve this; however, this would remove some punctuation, all emojis, and all emoticons that VADER could recognize for sentiment analysis [ 36 ]. VADER allows exclamation marks ”!” and question marks ”?”, which affect the sentiment score [ 36 ]. Our tokenization algorithm, as shown in Figure 4 , groups characters from every tokenized word into “alphabetical”, “punctuation”, or “emoticon” blocks of characters. Ideally, these three blocks of characters would allow VADER to join each of them to preserve most of the text VADER can recognize. To distinguish punctuation from emoticons, any characters in the set $ =@&_*#>:`\\\\</{})]|%;~-,([+^” are only part of an emoticon if they occur next to another character in the same set. To determine whether certain preprocessing functions contribute to predicting Bitcoin prices, the output of those functions in various combinations was scored by VADER. All text cleaning functions of the preprocessing stage were combined in 5 different pathways. Scores of the text at intermediate steps of each path were recorded to determine if a function offers any improvement to the results. The “cleaned”, “NLTK split”, “regex split”, and “no sw” functions shown in Figure 5 were combined to provide five different pathways. The “no sw” function was treated as the last step in any path, as no other function required word tokenization. Since VADER can be applied to a text of any length, the “cleaned”, “NLTK split”, and “regex split” functions produced a text of varying length. The “cleaned” and “split” functions were interchanged in different pathways. Both “split”, “cleaned”, and a “no sw” functions were applied afterward. The “cleaned” function can have either a “split” function used before the “no sw” stage. Our preprocessing combinations measured the scores of 13 intermediate steps (from 5 different pathways), as shown in Figure 6 . The text tweets and the preprocessed dataset are available for access and download in [ 37 ]. 4.3. VADER Sentiment and BTC Prices This section uses the Pearson correlation between the VADER scores of each of the 13 intermediate preprocessing steps over time with BTC’s closing prices per minute. As tweets are created much more frequently than once a minute, we aggregated all tweets’ scores into a per-minute feature in two ways. First, we averaged the negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores of all tweets within each minute. This strategy allows us to preserve VADER’s scoring property of the sentiment polarity scores summing to about 1. The second approach involves counting the number (or volume) of tweets that fit an overall sentiment polarity class. Each tweet can be classified as having an overall negative, neutral, or positive sentiment polarity based on its compound sentiment score. We consider any text with a compound VADER sentiment score below −0.05 as having an overall negative polarity, above 0.05, as having an overall positive polarity. Other scores have an overall neutral polarity. This produces 4 VADER sentiment score features and four sentiment volume features [ 13 ]. Since there were eight different features obtained for each of the 13 intermediate preprocessing steps over the whole dataset, the Bitcoin prices per minute were correlated against 104 unique time series of numbers. The resulting Pearson correlation score for each time series is displayed in a 13 × 8 heatmap matrix, as shown in Figure 7 . This correlation matrix represents the Pearson correlation values of all types of time-series with Bitcoin prices. Each time-series was constructed from the full length of tweet text posted between 22 May, 8:47 AM, and 23 May, 8:47 AM. To rank the effectiveness of different preprocessing strategies, an overall correlation value, the Average Feature Correlation Magnitude (AFCM), was constructed for each matrix row. For each strategy, the correlation values of all eight features are averaged by their absolute value to produce a single value in the rightmost column. While a few patterns can be seen from the matrix, they can change if a shorter time length of data or a different time series start date is used. We improve the correlation matrix by graphing correlation over different dataset lengths in the next section. 4.4. Feature Types and Correlation To account for differences in correlation due to the time length of the data used, we used subsets of data. The number of consecutive days of data varied and correlated with the respective Bitcoin prices occurring with the same timestamp. We will refer to this value as the correlation value of the subset. There are multiple unique subsets of data that span the same number of days. For example, a subset of 3 days of data can start on 22 May, 23 May, 24 May… 5 July, 6 July, and 7 July. Therefore, we averaged the correlation values from all unique subsets of data with the same length and differing start dates. The resultant value is independent of its start date (as much as it can be with a finite time length of collected data). Averaging the correlation values of all same-length subsets with different start dates should show us any correlation polarity (positive or negative) that a majority of subsets show. This is known as the Average Subset Correlation Polarity (ASCP, dashed line in figures). The correlation value could be positive, negative, or averaging; thus, we might hide how large the correlation values were and make the ASCP approach zero. To mitigate this effect, we can also average the absolute correlation values of all same-length subsets with different start dates to show the magnitude or strength of the correlation values. This is known as the Average Subset Correlation Magnitude (ASCM, solid line in all figures). The ASCP and ASCM are plotted as line graphs against the length of data in all subsets. The following eight figures show the ASCP and ASCM for common features produced from all 13 preprocessing strategies. A performance ranking scheme graph is included in those figures to rank each strategy from best to worst using the ASCM, for all subset data lengths. The 1st rank corresponds to the best performance and largest ASCM, while the 13th rank corresponds to the worst performance and smallest ASCM. The Pearson correlation average might not be a good representation of correlation magnitude if both positive and negative correlation values are averaged. Therefore, another experimental analysis using the absolute correlation value showing the average correlation magnitude per timespan length was conducted. For a total of 49.6 days of data, we measured all possible subset outcomes, and then we spanned contiguous days of data. Any subsets with the same timespan length and differing start dates had their outcomes averaged. This produced a time-series of correlation values for each of the cells in our correlation matrix. We graphed the correlation time-series for all preprocessing strategies that share the same aggregation score type in the same figure to display this data. Figure 8 shows the trends for the correlation of average negative VADER sentiment with Bitcoin prices for different data timespans. Most preprocessing strategies performed better than raw text when using less than 20 days of data and show a negative ASCP. The top-performing strategies involve cleaning and splitting sentences using the NLTK library in any order before removing their stopwords. A general pattern of combining text cleaning and sentence splitting in any order had a higher correlation than removing stopwords from those combinations. Splitting sentences without being combined with other functions performed worse than the latter two combinations. However, this trend was reversed when using more than 20 days of data, as a positive ASCP developed. Splitting sentences on their own performed better than removing stopwords from any order of cleaned sentence splitting, which served better than any order of cleaned sentence splitting. Few preprocessing strategies performed consistently better than raw text, such as splitting sentences using a regex when using 35 to 45 days of data. Thus, the correlation of average negative VADER sentiments per minute showed opposite trends for datasets of different time lengths. The effectiveness of using any preprocessing strategy over raw text decreased as more days of data were used. Cleaning and splitting text in any order on 20 days of data or less seemed to work best, while splitting raw text into sentences using regexes worked best on more extended datasets. The most significant dip in the ASCP of −0.105 occurred when correlating 8 to 15 days of data. The largest peak in the ASCP of 0.123 occurred when correlating about 40 to 49.6 days of data. Figure 9 shows the correlation of average neutral VADER sentiment with Bitcoin prices over different data timespans. The only preprocessing strategies that consistently performed better than using raw text were cleaning text, splitting text into sentences with the NLTK library, and splitting sentences using NLTK after cleaning text. In general, combining NLTK split sentences with cleaning in any order reduced its ASCM, and removing stopwords from them reduced it further. Similarly, eliminating stopwords from cleaned text reduced its ASCM. The best performing preprocessing strategies for the average VADER neutral score per minute do not involve regex splitting or removing stopwords. The highest peak in both ASCP and ASCM for all strategies occurred when using about 6 to 13 days of data, excluding the rise for one day of data. This range showed a positive correlation of about 0.135. Figure 10 shows the correlation between average positive VADER sentiment with Bitcoin prices. Cleaning text outperformed when using 1 or 2 days of data. Splitting sentences by using a regex performed better when using more than 20 days of data. A general pattern of combining text splitting functions with cleaning reduced their ASCM, and removing stop words reduced them further. This indicates that the best performing preprocessing strategies for the average positive VADER sentiment per minute is raw text, followed by single functions (cleaning or sentence splitting on their own). The largest negative peaks in ASCP, of −0.12 and −0.10, occurred when using about 5 to 8 and 31 to 38 days of data, respectively. Figure 11 shows correlation graphs of the average compound VADER sentiment at different timespans for the Bitcoin prices. No preprocessing strategies have a consistently higher ASCM than raw text. However, a few preprocessing strategies perform well for a few data subset lengths. Cleaned text, splitting sentences using the NLTK library, and splitting sentences using a regex performed better than using raw text when 1, 19, or more, and 34 or more data days were correlated. In Figure 11 , in general, the best preprocessing strategies used the least amount of combined functions. Combinations of functions that split sentences using the NLTK library performed better than those using a regex. Therefore, the preprocessing strategies for the average compound VADER score per minute using raw text for less than 19 days of data and splitting sentences using the NLTK library for greater data lengths performed the best among other strategies. The largest negative peaks in ASCP were −0.06, −0.08, and −0.10 when correlating 1, 5 to 7, and 34 to 44 days of data, respectively. Figure 12 shows the correlation graphs of negative tweets per minute with Bitcoin prices. The cleaned text and cleaned text with stopwords removed closely match the raw text correlation. Cleaned text performed better than raw text when using between 35 days and 47 days of data, coinciding with the largest peak in the ASCP. A general pattern of sentence splitting combined with text cleaning, with stopwords removed, performed better than any sole sentence splitting method, which performed better than any order of combining sentence splitting and cleaned text. There was a large gap in performance between the three top strategies: raw text, cleaned text, cleaned text without stopwords, and the other preprocessing strategies. Therefore, the ASCM of the volume of negative tweets per minute was the highest when using those three strategies. The highest peak in ASCP was 0.07, at 40 days of data. Another peak of about 0.055 occurred when using 4 to 6 days of data. Figure 13 shows the correlation graphs of neutral tweets per minute for Bitcoin prices at different timespans. The top preprocessing strategies are splitting sentences using the NLTK library or a regex. In general, strategies that do not use a regex to split sentences tend to follow raw text correlation closely. Preprocessing strategies that use less combined functions achieve a higher ASCM than otherwise. Therefore, the preprocessing strategy that allows the volume of neutral tweets per minute, which correlates the best with Bitcoin prices, is the NLTK library to split sentences. The highest peak in ASCP was 0.095 when using 6 to 13 days of data. Figure 14 shows the correlation of positive tweets per minute with Bitcoin prices. The preprocessing strategies that consistently performed better than using raw text were the sentence splitting functions combined with one or more functions, such as cleaning text and/or removing stopwords. The top two strategies that performed the best involve cleaning text before using a regex for sentence splitting. In general, preprocessing strategies that involve combining more functions perform better. Therefore, the best preprocessing strategy for correlating Bitcoin prices with the volume of positive tweets per minute involves cleaning text before sentence splitting by a regex function. The highest peak in ASCP was about 0.085 when using 12 to 20 days of data. Figure 15 shows the total correlation per minute of tweets for Bitcoin prices. No preprocessing strategy can affect the total amount of tweets received from Twitter per minute; hence every single preprocessing function would have ASCM and ASCP graphs, as in Figure 15 . The highest peak in the ASCP was 0.09 and occurred when correlating 6 to 20 days of data. It is worth noting that the correlation graphs of the total volume of tweets have a similar trend as the correlation graphs of the neutral and positive volumes of tweets. This may indicate that the correlation of the total volume of tweets shares more in common with the volumes of the neutral and positive tweets than negative tweets when using long-term datasets on a scale of days. The general trend of the above graphs shows the strongest correlation magnitude for shorter datasets of full-text tweet data and Bitcoin prices. When using one day of data for correlation, all ASCMs are significantly higher than when using all other timespans of data (except the average negative VADER scores per minute graphs). This could be a sign of sentiments expressed on Twitter, either responding to or anticipating a Bitcoin price change. However, the ASCPs, when using one day of data, are significantly lower than the respective ASCMs. This might show that any correlation observed with sentiments varies a lot depending on the date. We speculate that the substantial spike in correlation magnitude for a day of data on every graph indicates that correlation may become even stronger when observed on a shorter timescale, such as minutes instead of days. While there is no single preprocessing strategy that performs better than the rest for all feature types, we can see that cleaning text (and/or) splitting sentences is presented in most of the best strategies of each features. Any sentence splitting by itself seemed to work best for average VADER positive/neutral sentiment and neutral tweet volume, while NLTK splitting combined with cleaning worked best for average VADER neutral sentiment. Any sentence splitting also worked best for neutral tweet volume, while cleaning text worked best for negative tweet volume, and regex sentence splitting after cleaning text worked best for positive tweet volume. The feature types with the highest ASCMs around their highest peak were the positive/total tweet volume when a day of data was processed. No clear “best” features could be seen when all lengths of data subsets were considered. The highest ASCMs were all average VADER sentiments when less than 20 days of data were in each subset. ASCPs tended to show a second peak when processing 35 or more days of data to calculate the average VADER negative/positive/compound sentiments and negative tweet volume. These peaks may indicate longer-term data trends that continue outside of our 49.6 days of data, but they are typically low. However, they may be useful in machine learning algorithms that account for the past state, as recurrent neural networks. 5. Discussion In this paper, we contributed to BTC price forecasting literature by referring to the role of social media, namely Twitter messages, in the forecasting process [ 38 ]. It is most important to collect the tweets concerning people’s thoughts, emotions, and opinions about BTC during the period. The resulting sentiment scores from various preprocessing strategies are used to calculate the correlation coefficient with actual Bitcoin prices during the era of COVID−19. Our results indicate that the strongest correlation comes from processing a day’s worth of data, which has an unpredictable correlation polarity. However, some longer-term trends in correlation were observed when using ten days or 35+ data days, which might help machine learning algorithms that use temporal memory, such as recurrent neural networks. The patterns observed in processing full-length tweet text match closely with the patterns in processing truncated tweet text. This indicates that truncated tweet text is a suitable replacement for processing full-length tweet text at a reduced preprocessing cost, which helps process large datasets or real-time prediction systems such as KryptoOracle [ 22 ]. Although, in this paper, we used a short-term period for correlating tweets to BTC prices, the experimental period can be used as a sample for a long-term prediction for the entire period. We believe that we can apply the same preprocessing strategies to identify which one represents the BTC trend using the same set of strategies for the whole pandemic period. We expect that if the number of COVID-19 cases rises in specific regions and the tweets change, the proposed preprocessed strategies can work efficiently to provide well-fit representative data as long as we have the actual BTC price to compare with. Additionally, the collection period can be extended if the second wave of COVID-19 happens, such that a new corpus can be selected and matched to the actual BTC during the second wave. Recommendations for the optimum preprocessing strategies will be provided in the same trend provided in the experimental work. Although computing correlations in short time windows provide a well-fit preprocessed model for better BTC forecasting, a significant challenge remains in the unpredictable correlation polarity in longer-term trends. Our preprocessing methods using correlations can successfully be used as a groundwork for knowledge modeling through cognitive networks such as neural networks and deep learning to work directly on the most representative preprocessed Twitter data to the actual BTC price for forecasting. Furthermore, the most-fit preprocessing model can be used to predict the BTC price trends effectively. This paper demonstrated the adoption of natal language processing to assess users and decision-makers in perceiving and monitoring Bitcoin [ 39 ]. 6. Conclusions and Further Research In this paper, we identified the optimal preprocessing strategy of Bitcoin tweets introduced in the VADER-based Sentiment Analysis during the era of COVID-19. This paper used the VADER score from text preprocessing strategies to relate to the Bitcoin prices trend in this era. In general, we observe that features from cleaning text of tweet syntax and splitting text into sentences, in combination or separately, somewhat correlate with Bitcoin prices. However, the best preprocessing strategy to use depends on the feature you wish to extract from the text. More complex strategies are not guaranteed to correlate better. It can be concluded that the VADER score from text preprocessing shows a significant short-term correlation with Bitcoin prices. Future research involves investigating how datasets with timespans at each minute, instead of each day, relate to this work. We would also like to investigate if the correlation of our features with Bitcoin prices, from any of our preprocessing strategies, indicates how well a machine learning algorithm performs for predicting the BTC price from those features. Further future directions would involve selecting and correlating the optimal preprocessing strategy after COVID-19, at which we expect that the emotions and opinions on Twitter would change.

About Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market. First introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has held the crypto market’s number one spot according to market capitalization. Bitcoin paved the way for many existing altcoins in the market and marked a pivotal moment for digital payment solutions. As the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has come a long way in terms of its value. However, one does not have to buy an entire bitcoin as bitcoins can be divided into small units called satoshis, named after the creator. A satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin. There is no physical BTC token so Bitcoin operates as a digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are fully transparent and can’t be censored, providing a global, censorship-resistant medium for financial exchange. It’s a financial system backed by decentralized network of computers, known as ‘nodes’, instead of\\xa0 centralized banking or governmental entity, thereby promoting ‘decentralization’. Why Is the Bitcoin Price So Volatile? The price of Bitcoin has been highly volatile since it started because of several factors. Firstly, the crypto market is smaller and not heavily traded like traditional markets, so big trades can make the price swing substantially. Secondly, Bitcoin\\'s value depends on public sentiment and speculation, leading to short-term price changes. Media coverage, influential opinions, and regulatory developments create uncertainty, affecting demand and supply dynamics and contributing to price fluctuations. Another key factor is Bitcoin\\'s fixed supply. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to be minted, its scarcity can lead to dramatic price changes as demand varies. This is exacerbated by \"whales\" or large holders of Bitcoin, whose sizable transactions can sway the market considerably. When Was Bitcoin Created? Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital asset is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network and blockchain technology, allowing users to securely and anonymously send and receive transactions without intermediaries. Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, outlining the design and principles of the cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin transaction, which involved sending 10 bitcoins to a developer, took place on January 12, 2009. Since then, Bitcoin has gained traction as an alternative store of value and payment system, transforming the financial industry. Who Created Bitcoin? The creator of Bitcoin remains an enigma, known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin\\'s innovation emerged in 2008 when Nakamoto released the whitepaper outlining the cryptocurrency\\'s decentralized, peer-to-peer structure, and use of blockchain technology. In 2009, Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, and on January 12th of the same year, the inaugural Bitcoin transaction took place. Despite numerous investigations and speculations, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has not been disclosed. There have been a number of people who have been proposed as the possible identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, but none of these claims have been definitively proven. How Does Bitcoin Work? Bitcoin runs on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, making it possible for individuals to conduct transactions without intermediaries. Transactions are transparent and secure thanks to the underlying blockchain technology, which stores and verifies recorded transaction data. Miners validate transactions by solving complex mathematical problems with computational power. The first miner to find the solution receives a cryptocurrency reward, thus creating new bitcoins.\\xa0Upon validation, the data is added to the existing blockchain, and it becomes a permanent record. Bitcoin provides an alternative way to transact that\\'s transparent and secure, redefining traditional finance. When Is the Next Bitcoin Halving? The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024.\\xa0It\\'s difficult to predict the exact date as it depends on the block height. The block height refers to the number of blocks preceding a particular block in a blockchain. Bitcoin halving happens every 210,000 blocks and the next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April 2024 when the block height reaches 840,000. Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, where the rewards given to Bitcoin miners for mining blocks are cut in half. Halving was built into the Bitcoin protocol to maintain its value as a deflationary currency. By reducing the amount of new bitcoins, the protocol aims to prevent the devaluation of Bitcoin over time, which often happens with inflationary currencies. Will Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC’s Price? Historically, Bitcoin\\'s price has tended to increase in the months leading up to halving, as investors and traders anticipate a supply shock. After halving, the price may continue to rise if demand remains strong and outstrips the reduced supply. Other factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and global events can also impact the price of Bitcoin. Follow our Bitcoin Halving Countdown to know how Bitcoin halving works.

Never invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. In 2023, the cryptocurrency market has undergone notable fluctuations. With increasing regulations and legal challenges, investors wonder which crypto to buy. Amidst the surging volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) and Immutable (IMX) have sustained a bullish sentiment. Similarly, VC Spectra (SPCT) has emerged as a promising beginner cryptocurrency, having raised $2.4 million in private seed sales. But before we explore VC Spectra (SPCT), let’s compare Bitcoin (BTC) and Immutable (IMX) to determine the best crypto to buy in 2023. >>BUY SPCT TOKENS NOW<< Bitcoin (BTC) Registers Significant Gains Despite Regulatory Challenges Since the end of 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) has been navigating legal and regulatory challenges. The FTX crash in November 2022 caused Bitcoin’s (BTC) price to plunge below the $15,000 mark , defying analysts’ positive BTC price prediction. Following the fallout with FTX, investors speculated that the era of Bitcoin dominance was probably over. However, Bitcoin (BTC) surged to $23,000 in January 2023, refuting claims of a decline. Experts might attribute this to increased investor confidence after the U.S. implemented measures to combat inflation. Since then, experts have made a positive BTC price prediction despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) legal battle against the SEC, expecting the coin to surge as the 2024 halving event draws near. In July, Bitcoin (BTC) defied all expectations and surpassed the $29,000 mark. By September, its value had stabilized at around $26,000 . As a result, Changelly made a positive BTC price prediction , expecting the coin to reach a maximum value of $37,292 by the end of 2023, a 97% increase from last year’s valuation of $18,940 . Interestingly, Immutable (IMX) exhibits a similar scenario. Immutable (IMX) Soars to New Heights Immutable (IMX) has struggled with price fluctuations since the beginning of 2023. The coin surged substantially in February 2023 after Immutable’s (IMX) market share increased in the NFT industry. However, despite the surge, Immutable (IMX) failed to sustain these gains in the long term and suffered a bearish movement between March and August . According to CoinMarketCap, Immutable (IMX) has plunged by 20% from $0.739 to $0.592 since last year and stabilized around this mark in September. Experts might attribute this downtrend to a broader negative crypto sentiment stemming from the SEC’s crackdown on crypto. Even though Immutable (IMX) declined substantially, experts make a bullish prediction for the coin. According to Changelly, Immutable’s (IMX) average price is expected to be $1.68 , and the maximum price will be $1.79 by the end of 2023. While IMX sustained bullish sentiment, SPCT has also made tremendous strides throughout presale. VC Spectra (SPCT) Investors to Benefit from a 900% Surge Following Presale VC Spectra (SPCT) is a decentralized hedge fund focusing on providing sustainable returns to its users. The platform leverages artificial intelligence and creative trading strategies to identify lucrative investment opportunities. VC Spectra (SPCT) users can yield profit from multiple avenues. For instance, users can benefit from SPCT appreciation and VC Spectra’s (SPCT) monthly and quarterly dividends. VC Spectra’s SPCT is a BRC-20 token ingrained with a deflationary brun mechanism meant to preserve its value by reducing its supply over time. Users can use SPCT to pay transaction fees on VC Spectra or engage in decentralized trading . Besides incentivizing its token holders, VC Spectra (SPCT) has registered massive against throughout its presale. VC Spectra (SPCT) advanced to Stage 3 of its presale in September, generating 312.5% ROI to Stage 1 investors. More so, investors in Stage 1 will see an impressive profit of 900% when SPCT reaches its $0.080 target by the end of the public presale. These returns should grow even further as VC Spectra (SPCT) gets listed on centralized exchanges in 2024. Considering this huge growth, the best time to invest in SPCT is now.

Historically, November has always been significant for the cryptocurrency market, as BTC usually gains value, affecting other coins. According to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, November promises to be a pivotal month for Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors. Related Reading: What’s Behind XRP Price Retreat? Assessing Some Eye-Opening Metrics Bitcoin’s Ongoing Sideways Trend Hints At Potential Bullish Shift In November Market experts suggest that Bitcoin’s stagnant price movement might transition to a bullish trend in November. According to them, this could occur if it behaves similarly to past cycles before a halving event. For instance, on October 10, cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher referenced a chart from CryptoCon. In the X post, Miles highlighted the parallels between Bitcoin’s recent patterns and those observed in earlier cycles. #Bitcoin’s recent price action is still mirroring the last 2 cycles. This is typical sideways price action that occurs from Q2-Q4 in pre-halving years. November 21st has historically been the key pivot point for a bullish shift. Will be interesting to see how $BTC responds. pic.twitter.com/zP9vlG31Qc — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) October 10, 2023 He added that around November 21, the price of Bitcoin usually starts going up a lot, getting ready for the next halving event. This date holds significance as a turning point in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. For instance, in 2015, when Bitcoin’s price was ranging for about six months, it began to go up in November. Similarly, in 2019, the price of Bitcoin didn’t change much for most of the year, but then it started to increase towards the end of the year. Bitcoin’s price currently hovers at $27,568 in the daily chart. | Source: BTCUSD price chart from TradingView.com Other Crypto Analyst Predicts Similar Price Projections Another prominent crypto trader and analyst, Mags, noticed something interesting in Bitcoin’s chart. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s price is about 60% lower than the highest price it ever reached. This happened around 200 days before its previous halving, just like in 2015 and 2019. The analyst wrote: In 2016, BTC was -65% below its ATH. In 2019, BTC was -60% below its ATH. In 2023, BTC is currently -60% below its ATH. So, even if it seems like Bitcoin’s price isn’t moving much, it’s following a similar pattern to previous cycles. Another crypto analyst, Galaxy Trading , posited a similar prediction for Bitcoin’s price move. The analyst drew attention to 2018-2019 when Bitcoin’s price hit a significant bottom. He noted that Bitcoin could dump or bottom around Nov 10-15 this year if we see a similar price move. Additionally, lead researcher at Matrixport , Markus Thielen, said that Bitcoin’s price might go up massively by the end of 2024. However, he thinks it will happen for different reasons than what we’re seeing now. He drew attention to some critical areas in August 2012, December 2015, May 2019, and August 2020. According to him, the bullish market commenced within 12 to 18 months in each case. However, the Bitcoin halving is around six months away and might occur in late April or May, depending on your countdown timer.
